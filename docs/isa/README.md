# A18 Pro (G17P) AGX Shader ISA

Clean-room documentation of the Apple G17P shader instruction set. All facts here come from
disassembling **shaders we compiled ourselves** (OWN-SHADER) + public references (PUBLIC) —
never from Apple binaries. See `../../CLAUDE.md`.

> **Status: mature — census complete.** 85 machine-readable instruction descriptors (round-trip-validated asm↔disasm); the
> broad-corpus byte0 census tokenizes **100.0%** of instruction bytes — **0 undecoded regions, 0 undecoded byte0 groups**
> (EXP-M4-12 closed the last 2.6%: all length-rule gaps / 2-byte over-reads, no unknown opcodes; round-trip whole-program
> walk leaves 0 leftover bytes). ~79% of tokens are descriptor-named; the remainder are family-labeled "length-only" tokens
> whose operand sub-fields are deliberately left undecoded where doing so would transcribe a compiler sequence (clean-room
> rule 5). Authoritative encoding tables: [`encoding-tables.md`](encoding-tables.md) · Mesa-schema render: [`agx3.xml`](agx3.xml) (drop into `src/asahi/isa/`).
>
> **RT-1a-FIX (HW-re-validated red-team corrections applied):** memory-op **index register = byte+5** (not byte+1/+6; byte+6 inert; byte+1 = address space) + an in-instruction **immediate index-offset** at byte+9 bit7/+10/+11; **iadd2 polarity** corrected (byte0 `0x9f`=ADD, `0x1f`=SUBTRACT); a proper **float uniform-register source** (`falu2_uni`, disambiguated from the minifloat immediate by byte+1's exponent range); and descriptors/lengths for the four-byte byte0 `0x60` form + the byte+2=`0x18` compact float-accumulate. The A18 splice validates the 0x60 form's length/live byte, not a universal spill role: EXP-0041 found `60 00 00 00` absent from all nine retained M4 own mains including 208–576 B scratch. See `experiments/RT-1a-FIX/` and `experiments/EXP-0041-scratch-helper-abi/`.
> ✅ = hardware-validated (run modified code, observe output); ⏳ = byte-diff-inferred, not yet HW-round-tripped.

## Emittability status — what an implementer can actually *generate* (measured)

> **Read this before using any encoding table in this file.** *Decoding* and *emitting* are
> different claims. `tools/agx-isa/db.json` round-trips the corpus **302/302**, which proves the
> tables can tokenize and re-serialize observed bytes; it does **not** prove that an emitter can
> put an arbitrary legal value in a field and get the documented behaviour. The per-field
> labelling standard that separates the two is [`../evidence-classification.md`](../evidence-classification.md)
> (row `DOC-02`), and the live measured state is the `coverage` block of
> `tools/agx-isa/validation.json` (`generated: 2026-09-03`, `db_sha256 00afaf3d…`).

**Measured state — `target: G16G` (Apple M4).** Every field label below was established by an
experiment that ran on the **local M4 / G16G**. It is **not** relabelled G17P and does not
transfer: see "Target status" at the end of this section.

| | |
|---|---|
| Instructions in the database | **176** |
| Instructions **EMITTABLE** | **35** |
| Instructions **decodable, not yet emittable** | **141** |
| Fields total | **1109** |
| Fields at **emitter grade** (`hardware-run` 531 + `isolated-byte-diff` 67) | **598 = 53.9 %** |

Per-label field counts, strongest first, with what each one licenses a compiler back-end to do:

| label | fields | % | what an emitter may do with it | CODEX ladder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hardware-run` | 531 | 47.9 % | Emit **arbitrary values inside the field's recorded `range`**. The field was given values the compiler would never choose — boundaries, holes, out-of-range — spliced into a real program and executed. | `HW-VALIDATED` |
| `isolated-byte-diff` | 67 | 6.0 % | Emit **only at the tested points**. An isolated byte change in code compiled from our own MSL ran with the predicted effect, but the range was not swept. | `HW-VALIDATED` (point) |
| `corpus-correlation` | 75 | 6.8 % | **Do not synthesize.** Meaning inferred from co-variation across our own compiled shaders; nothing was executed. Reproduce the observed value. | `STRUCTURAL` |
| `tokenization-only` | 148 | 13.3 % | **Do not synthesize.** The field exists so length/framing round-trips; its semantics are unknown. | `STRUCTURAL` |
| `single-template-inference` | 32 | 2.9 % | **Do not synthesize.** Read out of exactly one example — could be a constant, a don't-care, or load-bearing. | `INFERRED` |
| `api-accept-reject` | 0 | 0 % | A statement about what Metal/the compiler service accepts, **not** about the hardware field. | `INFERRED` |
| `host-private` | 0 | 0 % | Not a field userspace fills. | *(out of scope)* |
| `untested` | 256 | 23.1 % | A **gap**. It is listed so you can see it, not so you can fill it by guessing. This is the default for any field with no explicit label. | `UNKNOWN` |

**The 35 emittable mnemonics** (every emitter-filled field at `hardware-run` or
`isolated-byte-diff`; `tools/agx-isa/validation.json` → `coverage.emittable_mnemonics`):

`bf_add_dst` · `bf_alu` · `bf_fma_dst` · `carry_gen` · `cvt_bf16` · `cvt_f2h` ·
`cvt_f2h_dst` · `cvt_i2f` · `device_store` · `falu2` · `falu2_uni` · `falu3` ·
`falu3_ext` · `falu3_srcmod12` · `falu_acc` · `fspecial` · `h_coord_hi` ·
`half_alu_ext8` · `hminmax` · `ibitcount` · `isel10` · `iter_at` · `iter_flat` ·
`mov_imm` · `mov_zext16` · `n3_mov` · `pack_convert` · `pixel_order` · `psel` ·
`reg_move_cb` · `rtq_state_move` · `sel` · `simd_shuffle` · `sr_read_wide` · `uniform_mov`

> ⚠️ **Read "emittable" strictly.** It means *every emitter-filled field of that descriptor is
> `hardware-run` or `isolated-byte-diff`*. It does **not** mean the instruction covers every
> semantic role a compiler might want from it. The clearest example is the `reg_move_*` /
> `uniform_mov` cluster: it is emittable for its **immediate** and **uniform-register** source
> classes, while a general **GPR→GPR move from a register a preceding computation wrote** remains
> an open hard negative ([`register-move-and-liveness.md`](register-move-and-liveness.md) §1.0).

**Everything else in this file is "decodable, not yet emittable".** Per `DOC-02`'s verbatim
rule — *"do not use 'emittable' for a family whose arbitrary operands have not executed"* — a
✅ in a section heading below means the *claim in that section* was hardware-validated. It does
**not** mean every field of that instruction can be freely synthesized. Check
`validation.json` per field before emitting.

**Why the distinction bites harder here than on most ISAs.** On Apple9 a wrong operand-field
value overwhelmingly produces a **silent zero, not a fault**. Measured instances from the
2026-08-28 emitter wave, all `target: G16G`:

- `device_load` destination register `R ≥ 64` — silently zeroes, no fault (EXP-0141).
- `tile_read` byte+6 bit 0 clear, or a wrong `rt_index` — silent zero, i.e. a **black tile**
  in a BG/EOT program rather than a failed command buffer (EXP-0147).
- `matrix_mac.dst_desc` outside `bit6=1, bit7=0` — 128 of 256 values silently zero (EXP-0147).
- `get_sr.dp_width` / `.dp_marker`, `psel.mode` / `.flag`, `ret.linkmode` — each accepts only a
  masked subset; outside it the usual outcome is a **silent wrong value** (EXP-0140).
- `falu2.mod_lo` bit 2 — reads `0.0` at the very index where the neighbouring class reads a
  live operand (EXP-0138).

A driver that fills an unvalidated field with a plausible-looking value therefore fails
quietly and far from the cause. That is the reason this whole labelling standard exists.

**Target status (current rule).** All sixteen P0/P1 closure rows are now measured against
**full G17P**, and all live testing has moved to the A18 Pro / G17P (`CODEX.md` "Target
discipline", user directive 2026-08-28). Every field label counted above was, however,
measured on **M4 / G16G**. Those results remain **valid on their own target** and are not
retracted; they are **not** promoted to G17P. G17P revalidation is under way (`EXP-0153`), and
cross-target promotion requires a recorded validation or an explicit `INFERRED` label —
never a silent relabel.

## How we get the bytes (validated — EXP-0001)

Our own MSL → runtime `newLibraryWithSource:` → compute pipeline → `MTLBinaryArchive`
`serializeToURL:` → parse with **our own** parser (`tools/shdump/agxparse.py`):

- The serialized archive is a **Metal fat binary** (magic `0xCBFEBABE`).
- Inside, the **AppleGPU** image = Mach-O `cputype 0x1000013` (the native GPU code we want),
  distinct from the **AIR64** image `cputype 0x1000017` (LLVM bitcode; `MTLB`/`BC\xC0\xDE`).
- The AppleGPU image's `__TEXT,__compute` section is itself a **nested Mach-O**; its
  `__TEXT,__text` holds the code, split by symbols into:
  - `_agc.main` — the shader program.
  - `_agc.main.constant_program` — a fixed 64-byte prolog ("constant program").
- **Evidence it is machine code, not IR:** the AIR64 image carries the `BC\xC0\xDE` magic; the
  AppleGPU `__text` does not and does not parse as bitcode. An empty kernel's whole body is a
  single 4-byte word (raw instruction, not IR). Determinism: identical source → byte-identical
  `_agc.main` across repeated compiles (sha256-stable).

## Preliminary encoding observations (EXP-0001)

Byte-level facts (established) and their interpretations (⏳ pending round-trip validation):

- **Instruction parcels are 2 bytes.** All observed region lengths are even. ⏳ (variable-length
  instructions built from 2-byte parcels, as on G13, is the working hypothesis.)
- **✅ Float ALU op-select (HARDWARE-VALIDATED, EXP-0003):** in a `c=a+b` kernel, the byte at
  file/program offset **`0x22`**, **bit 0**, selects the float ALU op: **`1c`=fadd, `1d`=fmul**.
  Proven by splicing `1c→1d` and observing the dispatch output change from `a+b` to `a*b`
  (`1,2,3…×10,20,30…` → `10,40,90,…`), byte-identical to the compiler's own `fmul` output.
- **`0e000000` is NOT a simple required trailing stop (revised, EXP-0003).** Corrupting it (past
  the store) did not fault; program extent appears bounded by metadata / the final store, not by
  a mandatory terminator word. ⏳ true program-end / control-flow-termination encoding still TBD.
- **Fixed preamble:** every non-empty `_agc.main` begins `1c a0 10 06 …`. ⏳ role TBD.
- **Packed float immediate:** `a+1.0` vs `a+2.0` differ in **one byte** (bits 4–6), and the
  value is **not** IEEE-754 (`3f800000`/`40000000` do not appear) — a compact/packed float
  immediate encoding. ⏳ exact encoding TBD (sweep needed).
- **Source-register selectors:** `a-b` vs `b-a` swap two bytes (complementary `00↔01`) → the
  two source operand fields. ⏳ register-index bit layout TBD.
- **Integer vs float ALU use different encoding paths** (int-add vs float-add differ in length
  and many bytes).

### Negative result (EXP-0001)
- **Buffer *binding index* is not in the shader code.** Writing `buffer(0)` vs `buffer(1)`
  produced byte-identical `_agc.main`, prolog, *and* `__TEXT,__descriptor`. The compiler assigns
  the referenced buffer a fixed uniform slot; the Metal binding index is resolved at bind time
  (argument/uniform table), outside the AGX program. → A cmdstream/descriptor-phase question.

## Extraction & testbed now cover compute, vertex, AND fragment (EXP-0008)
- `shdump --render` compiles our own `[[vertex]]`+`[[fragment]]` MSL and extracts both stages.
  Archive layout: the same Metal fat binary → one AppleGPU image, with **vertex and fragment as
  separate `__TEXT,__vertex` / `__TEXT,__fragment` sections** in that one image (compute is
  `__TEXT,__compute`); each is a nested Mach-O carved by `_agc.main`/`_agc.main.constant_program`
  exactly like compute. `agxparse.py --stage {compute,vertex,fragment}` selects the stage.
- `tools/agxtest/agxrender.m` — a **render testbed**: draws a full-screen triangle with our own
  archived vertex+fragment code into a small target and reads back pixels, and **runs modified
  fragment code** (splice-and-observe validated: editing a fragment byte moved the output pixel
  color). The extrapolate-and-test loop now works for fragment shaders too.
- **New instruction groups seen only in vertex/fragment code** (byte0 leaders; ⏳ lengths/semantics
  pending a decode experiment): low-nibble-`f` ALU `0x2f/0x3f/0xaf` (interp/tex/deriv), extra
  memory `0x07/0x87/0x97/0xa7`, vertex varying-stores `0x05/0x06/0x57`; by feature-attribution,
  **texture sample** adds `0x18/0xb0`, **derivatives** add `0x37/0x38/0x39/0x90/0x92`.

## Instruction encoding (EXP-0005)

The machine-readable, authoritative encoding lives in **`tools/agx-isa/`** — one descriptor
table (`db.json` / `isadb.py`) drives both the **assembler** and **disassembler**, with a
passing round-trip test (`asm(disasm(bytes))==bytes` on 14 real instructions; `disasm(asm(x))==x`
on 5 synthesized). Prose summary below; treat the DB as source of truth.

> **Encoding tables (all instruction descriptors, rendered):** [`encoding-tables.md`](encoding-tables.md) — the self-contained, per-instruction bit-field tables (byte0 group, length, match bits, every field + enum), grouped by family; generated from `db.json` by `tools/agx-isa/gen_encoding_tables.py` (EXP-0036).

Encoding is **little-endian**: instruction bit 16 = byte +2 bit 0.

### ✅ Instruction-length rule (validated)
> **Census reality (RT-1a/RT-1b → RT-ISA-FIX):** the DB tokenizes ~**87–91%** of instruction bytes on a broad corpus
> (EXP-0036 subcorpus **90.6%**); it is NOT "0 leftover" on every realistic kernel. **RT-ISA-FIX closed the biggest
> named gaps:** the **`0x0f` execution-mask family** is now fully decoded (`jump`/`jump_cond`/`if_push`/`pop_reconverge`/
> `call_indirect`/`mask_op` — 42/42 `0x0f` ops tokenize on an if/else/while/for/break/continue/nested corpus), the
> **`0x07` fence** byte+2∈{`0x00`,`0x02`} variant (`scoreboard_fence`, 4B) is decoded, and `0x32` carry-gen was already
> merged. RT-ISA-FIX also fixed two **mis-/non-decodes** of real compiled subgroup ops: `simd_ballot(pred)` (`17 17 54`,
> byte+1=`0x17`, was mis-decoded as `unpack_convert`) and `simd_shuffle` (`47/c7 04 54`, byte+2=`0x54`, was undecodable).
> Remaining residue is operand-level (the `0x2b`/`0x3b`/`0x5b` register/shift-prep family). These are naming/length gaps,
> not correctness errors in the decoded ops.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **EXP-0148 correction (2026-08-28) — the length rule was reading the NEXT instruction's opcode.**
> The rule chooses 6/8/10/12 from **`byte+4`**, but for the **compact** forms `byte+4` *is the
> following instruction's leader* — and AGX leaders overwhelmingly end in low nibble `7`/`f`
> (`&3 == 3` → 12) or `1`/`5`/`9`/`d` (`&3 == 1` → 8). A 4-byte op therefore read its successor's
> opcode and swallowed it. **The form must be selected from the leading parcel before the
> `byte+4` extension is consulted.** Four corrections applied:
>
> | id | rule |
> |---|---|
> | **L1** | byte0 low nibble `9`, op-select (`byte+2` bits[2:0]) ∈ {0,1} → **length 4** (the compact float accumulate/move class) |
> | **L2** | byte0 low nibble `9`, `byte+2` ∈ {`0x26`,`0x2e`} → the **uniform** `6 + 2*(byte+4 & 3)`, replacing `8 if (byte+4 & 2) else 6` plus two hand-patches |
> | **L3** | byte0 `0x10` (native fp16) with `byte+2` in the compact set → **length 4** |
> | **L4** | byte0 low nibble `b` → **length 10** when `(byte+2 & 0x06) == 0x06`, excluding `byte+2` ∈ {`0xd7`,`0xe7`} |
>
> **`falu2_ext8b` was deleted — it was never an instruction.** Its match is exactly the
> op-select-{0,1} space L1 now lengths to 4, which is why 193 of its 250 corpus instances embedded
> a real op leader. `tg_atomic_prep` is replaced by a corrected 10-byte `tg_atomic_prep10`; new

>
> Corpus effect: files tokenizing end-to-end **803 → 832**, strict leftover bytes

Parcels are 2 bytes. **Unlike G13, the *first* parcel does not always encode length** (e.g. `fsub`
and extended FMA forms can share it). Length is a family-local prefix decision; the current
normative framing table is `../../../APPLE9_INSTRUCTION_LENGTHS.md` at the workspace root.

| byte 0 | group | length (bytes) |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0e` | stop | 4 |
| low-nibble `0xC` | preamble | 4 |
| low-nibble `0x7` (`67`/`e7`) | device load/store | 14 |
| low-nibble `0x9` | float ALU | 4 when `(byte[+2] & 7) in {0,1}`; otherwise normally `6 + 2*(byte[+4] & 3)` (exact coordinate subforms take priority) |
| `0x0b` | float unary | 10 — **UNVERIFIED against the live tokenizer (flagged 2026-08-30 by `check_doc_lengths.py`).** A zero-filled byte0 probe returns **4**, and **no byte0 = `0x0b` encoding appears in the sampled committed raw**, so this row cannot be confirmed or refuted here. It is an early-wave claim (EXP-0005) that no later experiment revisited. Treat as `INFERRED` until a real encoding is dispatched. |
| `0x12` | float min/max | 6 |
| `0x9f`/`0x1f` | integer ALU | 10 when byte `+1` bit 0 is set; otherwise 12 |

Current regression proof is `tools/agx-isa/length_canary_test.py` plus
`tools/agx-isa/roundtrip_test.py`; the latter walks 74 complete own-generated programs with zero
leftover and byte-exact re-serialization.

### ✅ Float ALU 2-source op-select (HARDWARE-VALIDATED, 256-value sweep)
For the `0x09` float-ALU instruction, the op-select is a **3-bit field = instruction bits
[16:19]** (low 3 bits of byte +2):

| bits[16:19] | op | status |
|---|---|---|
| `0b100` | **fadd** (`a+b`) | ✅ HW-validated (all 8 don't-care combos) |
| `0b101` | **fmul** (`a*b`) | ✅ HW-validated |
| `0b111` | illegal → contained GPU hang | HW-observed |

Field decomposition (from the sweep): bit 0 = add/mul (the EXP-0003 bit, now seen as bit 0 of a
wider field); bit 1 = length/fma bit; bit 2 = arithmetic-enable; bits 3–5 = don't-care; bits 6–7
set ⇒ srcA passthrough. Only add/mul are *validated*; sub/min/max/fma use different formats
(inferred, tracked in `db.json` provenance — not claimed as op-select values).

### ✅ Float ALU 2-source operand encoding (HARDWARE-VALIDATED, EXP-0006)
6-byte `falu2` instruction, little-endian (bit b → byte b//8, bit b%8):

| bits | field | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `[0:4]` | group | `0x9` = float ALU |
| `[4:8]` | **dst** | destination register number |
| `[8]` | srcA size | 1 = 32-bit, 0 = 16-bit (reads low halfword) |
| `[9:16]` | srcA reg | source-A register number |
| `[16:19]` | op-select | `100`=fadd, `101`=fmul (see above) |
| `[19]` | imm sign | sign bit when srcB is an immediate |
| `[24]` | srcB size | 1 = 32-bit, 0 = 16-bit low half |
| `[25:32]` | srcB reg | source-B register number (or minifloat when imm mode) |
| `[39]` | **srcB imm mode** | 0 = srcB is a register, 1 = srcB is an immediate |
| `[43]` | **srcB negate** | negate source B (`a + (−b)` ⇒ subtract) |

- **Source operand byte = `(reg << 1) | is32`.** 16-bit reads the low halfword of the 32-bit
  register (HW-confirmed: a 16-bit read returned the low half of the float32).
- **No srcA-negate bit in the 6-byte form**; the compiler commutes operands to reuse srcB-negate.
- **abs / extended modifiers** live in a distinct **10-byte** extended form (`09 01 1c 05 02 00
  00 80 0X 00`); HW-validated `a+|b|`. There is also a `0x10` native-half 2-source group.
- **✅ saturate / output-clamp is a NATIVE modifier bit (EXP-M4-10 ISA-2, HW-splice).** `saturate(x)`
  and `clamp(x,0,1)` compile to the **8-byte** extended form with a single output-clamp bit at
  **byte+7 bit1 (0x02)**: fadd `09 05 1c 01 00 c0` → `09 05 1c 01 01 00 00 82` (fp16 mirror
  `10 03 1c 02 01 00 00 82`). Splicing that bit 0x82→0x80 turns clamped 1.0 back into 1.5 — no
  min/max op is emitted, so it is **native, not lowered**. General `clamp(x,lo,hi)` (lo,hi≠0,1) IS
  lowered to explicit fmax/fmin. The **extended-form length = `6 + 2*(byte+4 & 3)`** (0→6 compact,
  1→8 saturate, 2→10 abs) and the SAME rule extends `fma` (0x81→8 / 0x82→10 saturate / 0x83→12 abs).
- **✅ per-operand abs/neg map (EXP-M4-10 ISA-3).** falu2 (6B): srcB-slot negate = **byte+5 bit3**
  (splice-proven: 5+3=8 → byte+5 0xc0→0xc8 → −2); abs → 10B form, abs-enable **byte+8** (bit0 slotB /
  bit1 slotA). fma (8B): multiplicand negate = **byte+7 bit3**, addend negate = **byte+4 bit4**,
  addend abs = **byte+4 bit3**, src-abs → 12B (byte+4=0x83).

### ✅ `falu2` operand SOURCE-CLASS model + an inline float immediate (EXP-0138) — `target: G16G`

`falu2` is the most-used instruction in the ISA and it is now **EMITTABLE**: its last blocking
field, `mod_lo`, is `hardware-run` dense over all 8 values, with an identical per-case outcome
map in three independent runs (98/98 cases each, 294/294 overall). Evidence label
**`HW-VALIDATED`** (splice-and-observe), `target: G16G` (local Apple M4, macOS 26.6.2/25G82).
Source: `experiments/EXP-0138-m4-emit-falu/RESULTS.md` §2–§3.

**`mod_lo` is not a spare modifier — it is an operand-source-class field.**

| bits | selects | values |
|---|---|---|
| **bit 0** | `srcA`'s source class | `0` = GPR at `srcA_reg`. `1` = a second class that **returned `0.0` at every index tested** (`srcA_reg` ∈ {0, 6}). It is **NOT** the uniform file: at `srcA_reg = 6`, where the uniform file holds `101.0`, `mod_lo = 1` still produced `0.0`. |
| **bits[2:1]** | `srcB`'s source class | `0` = GPR at `srcB_reg`; `1` = the **non-GPR operand file** addressed by `srcB_reg` (below); `2` and `3` both read **`0.0`**, and **bit 2 dominates bit 1** — `mod_lo = 6` reads `0.0` at the very index where `mod_lo = 2` reads `101.0`. |

The pre-registered hypothesis (bit 0 = "srcA reads the uniform file"; bit 2 behaves like bit 1)
was **REFUTED in both halves** and replaced by the rule above, which was then scored against
every case. The pre-registered refuter fired as designed: `mod_lo = 2` with `srcB_reg = 2` (an
unbound uniform index) returned `5.0`, not the GPR answer `8.0`.

**In source class 1, `srcB_reg` 64..127 is an inline 8-bit minifloat immediate.** `srcB_reg`
**bit 6 is live in this class**, which is why it was invisible in GPR mode, where EXP-0099 /
EXP-0112 correctly found bit 6 inert (`r(R mod 64)` aliasing).

| `srcB_reg` range | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0..63` | uniform-register file index. The bound `constant float4& = {101,202,303,404}` appeared at indices **6..9**. |
| `64..127` | **inline 8-bit minifloat immediate**, `k = srcB_reg − 64`, `e = k >> 3`, `m = k & 7`: `value = m · 2^-5` when `e == 0`, else `value = (8 + m) · 2^(e−6)`. |

**Ten HW-confirmed points** (`k` → value): `0`→0, `2`→0.0625, `3`→0.09375, `31`→1.875,
`32`→2.0, `48`→8.0, `56`→16.0, `61`→26.0, `62`→28.0, `63`→30.0.

- **Safety consequence:** indices **126/127 do NOT fault in this mode** — they are the
  immediates 28.0 and 30.0 — unlike GPR mode, where EXP-0112 recorded a fault. **The register
  model does not transfer across `mod_lo` classes.**
- *Editorial cross-reference (arithmetic identity of two already-documented formulas, not a new
  measurement):* this value table produces the same magnitude set `{0, 1/32 … 30.0}` as the
  bit-39 packed immediate documented under "Packed float immediate = 8-bit minifloat" below —
  substituting `e = exp − 8`, `m = mant` turns one formula into the other. They are two
  *routes* to the same minifloat table, reached by different encoding fields.
- **Carrier-specific, stated as such:** uniform index `10` read back ≈1.0 in this carrier. That
  is `kernels/carrier_uni.metal`'s own literal, not a hardware fact; the experiment's
  `analysis/model_check.py` marks it `CARRIER_SPECIFIC`.

**Three further float-ALU instructions became emittable in the same wave** (`target: G16G`):

- **`copysign` (4 B): `operands` (byte+3) is INERT** — all 256 values return the same result.
  That is a hardware fact, not a dead path: the pre-registered falsifier arm on byte+1 fired
  hard (240/256 values silently zero, 8 return −5.0, 8 return +5.0). `db.json` models byte+1 and
  byte+2 as fixed match constants; **byte+1 is a live operand field and byte+2 is a 256/256
  don't-care.**
- **`half_alu`: byte+1 is the FIRST SOURCE DESCRIPTOR, not the destination** (`dst`/`opflags`
  both dense `hardware-run`). Descriptor **bit 7 is confirmed inert** (`0x82` ≡ `0x02`,
  `0x84` ≡ `0x04`) — an independent reproduction of EXP-0099's inert-top-bit finding on a
  different family. `opflags` 0..7 behave as the anchor; 8..29 change the result
  (release-source semantics, cf. EXP-0086/0099); 10..31 silently zero.
- **`half_alu_ext8`:** `dst`, `opflags`, `b7_lo`, `b7_mid` all dense `hardware-run`;
  `b7_lo`/`b7_mid` inert across their whole range.

**Negative and safety results (first-class, `target: G16G`):**

- ⛔ **`fspecial`'s OPERANDS ARE SWAPPED in older documentation — read this before emitting one.**
  `db.json` used to say `dst` = byte+1's high nibble, `src` = byte+3, `src_ext` = byte+5. The
  hardware says otherwise, and the failure is silent:

  | byte | what it actually is | rule | evidence (G17P) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | byte+1 high nibble | pending-mask bits 0..3 | bit 4→slot 1, bit 7→slot 4 | full slot cross, EXP-M4-42 |
  | **byte+3** | **destination** register | `reg = v >> 1`; bit 0 aliases | all 192 safe values per run, r0..r95 |
  | **byte+5** | **source** register | `reg = v >> 2`; bits 0..1 alias | all 256 values per run, r0..r63 |

  EXP-0161's earlier `(v & 0xFE) == 0` and `(v & 0xFC) == 0` mask statements described which
  mutations reproduced one fixed-register baseline; they were not legality requirements. EXP-0237
  generates and executes the entire positive namespaces with register-specific exact values.
  In its materialized FP32 direct-round carrier, byte+3 bit 0 and byte+5 bits 0..1 are accepted
  aliases; use zero for the canonical encoding, but do not call the other encodings illegal.
  **An emitter following the old layout puts the destination in a byte that does nothing
  and the source in the byte that redirects the destination — the program runs, faults nothing,
  and silently writes the wrong register.** Established three ways, including **20/20 generated
  `r_i = rsqrt(r_j)` encodings that Apple's compiler never emitted** (the old model scored 10 fail
  + 10 unpredictable on the same bytes). `EXP-0161` (DEF-0161-1), re-derived independently from
  raw and confirmed by `EXP-0165`; complete direct reach and release lifecycle are `EXP-0237`.

- ⛔ **`fspecial` destination register ≥ 96 faults or hangs the GPU.** `reg = byte+3 >> 1` maps
  values 0..191 onto **r0..r95 — exactly the 96-entry GPR file** — so the safe rule is
  *register < 96*, not the earlier "byte+3 bit 7 clear". Measured: 45 of 64 values in 192..255
  give a genuine `ErrorHang`, 19 were swamped by neighbouring contexts' resets and never cleanly
  observed, and **0 ever worked**. Earlier isolated-host runs saw 192/193/194 each hang three
  times in a row under a 12 s watchdog. The same ≥96 boundary appears independently across seven
  unrelated instructions (`iter.dst`, `iter_at.dst`, `frag_color_pack.dst`,
  `simd_{ballot,reduce,shuffle}.dst`, `imageblock_store.src`), where `(v & 0xC0) == 0xC0` faults
  and the same plus bit 1 **hangs** — so it is a property of the register file, not of `fspecial`.

- **Canonical `fspecial` register lifecycle (G17P EXP-0237; corrected on G16G by EXP-M4-41/42).**
  Byte+5 names r0..r63 and byte+3 writes r0..r95. Source release is not inherent in byte+5:
  **byte+6 bit 4 is the independent source last-use control**. Native reciprocal emits `0x00`
  when the source remains live and `0x10` when it dies; a bit-only mutation preserves `1/x` but
  makes a later source read return zero. Instruction bits 12..17 are the six-slot pending dependency
  mask: byte+1's high nibble names slots 1..4, and byte+2's low bits name slots 5 and 6. Thus `0x54`
  means no dependency, `0x55` slot 5, `0x56` slot 6, and `0x57` both; unions are legal. This
  supersedes EXP-M4-41's initial boolean handoff interpretation. Byte+4 bit 1 is required for a
  nonzero result, while bit 0 is only a native low-pressure result-use correlation so far.

- **Canonical `cvt_f2i` register lifecycle (G17P, EXP-0238).** In the ten-byte materialized-source
  FP32-to-signed-I32 form, byte+5 exhaustively selects and releases `r[byte5 >> 2]`, so it directly
  reaches r0..r63 and cannot represent physical r64..r95; bits 0..1 are accepted aliases in this
  envelope. Byte+3 selects `r[byte3 >> 1]` and writes every physical r0..r95; bit 0 aliases. Eight
  source=destination cases prove release precedes integer-result publication and the result wins.
  EXP-0168 independently exhausted the finite destination boundary: byte values 192..255 (r96+)
  are invalid, with 255/256 carrier/run observations reporting `ErrorHang` and one neighbouring
  `InnocentVictim`. These access sets are not inherited by unsigned, half, pending-producer, or
  alternate conversion forms.

- ⛔ **`imad` has NO first operand in older documentation.** `db.json` modelled no `srcA` at all;
  the byte it called `srcC_lo` (byte+6) is the **first multiplicand's register selector**,
  `reg = (byte+6) >> 3`, reproduced in both seed sets and solved from scratch with both
  multiplicands free (132 two-dimensional points, 0 unsolved). **An implementer following the old
  descriptor cannot choose the first operand of an integer multiply.** Related: `imad.srcC_desc`
  is not one field — bits 0,1 are a mode (`11` → reproducible fault), bit 2 is inert, and bits
  3..7 select an addend **that is not in the instruction** (the recovered addends are the 16-bit
  halves of the *carrier's own* float constants). `byte+5`'s role is unresolved and was never
  swept — do not assume `(reg << 1) | size` there. `EXP-0160` (DEF-0160-6), confirmed by `EXP-0165`.

- ⛔ **`op04_len8`'s declared 8-byte length is REFUTED on hardware — do not emit this descriptor.**
  A register-witness probe measuring consumed length directly (2,304 measurements, both controls
  passing, one proving it can detect a 6-byte length) shows all six patterns from our own G17P
  compiles consume **twelve** bytes; the `0x04` leader's length is a joint function of `byte+1`
  bit 7 and `byte+2`. The corrected rule was **not** applied to the decoder because it regresses
  the corpus gate, so the conflict is unresolved and the descriptor carries an `EMITTABLE VETO`.
  Emitting 8 bytes would desynchronise every instruction after it. `EXP-0157`.
- **`falu_srcmod12b.srcB_neg` and `.mod_lo` are inert** at the operands tested, although the
  *same-named* fields on `falu2` are live. **Do not assume one operand model across the
  float-ALU families** — the same lesson EXP-0139 recorded for `iadd2.dst`.
- `falu_srcmod12b` and `half_alu_fma12` remain **`emit_unsafe` regardless of their field
  labels** (`falu_srcmod12b` `opsel == 4` corrupts an unrelated, independently seeded register —
  EXP-0119).
- **`falu3`/`falu3_ext` field NAMES in `db.json` are misleading** (confirmed): byte0's high
  nibble is the **destination** (`dst_lo`), byte+1 (`dst`) is the FIRST SOURCE, byte+3 (`srcA`)
  the SECOND, byte+5 (`srcC`) the THIRD, and byte+4 (`srcB`) is a CONTROL byte whose low 2 bits
  are the 0x09-group length selector. An emitter following the names would put the destination
  in a source slot.
- **Scope limit:** 7-bit register fields were swept `0..15` dense plus 17 boundary values,
  **not** `0..127` dense. Wide `ext`/`ext_srcmod` tails are `isolated-byte-diff` only — each
  constituent byte was swept 0..255, the full 16/32/48-bit space is **not** claimed.

### ✅ Machine model — registers, uniforms, Dynamic Caching (EXP-0020, supersedes EXP-0006 "64")
- **96 addressable 32-bit GPRs per thread** (r0–r95, **96 DISTINCT registers — a hard silicon boundary**).
  The compiler's register footprint grows then caps at exactly 96; a kernel with 93 (and even 96) live regs +
  zero scratch runs correctly. (EXP-0006's "64" was a tiny-shader artifact of the nibble-compacted `falu2` dst
  field.) **r96–r127 behave as out-of-file (RT-7, HW):** used as a **memory-index register** (`device_load`
  byte+5) they **hard-FAULT** (`CMDBUF_ERROR`) with a clean r95/r96 boundary; used as an **ALU source** they
  **read 0** (no fault). **Neither aliases live data** — r96+ never returns another live register's value, and
  r64 ≠ r0 (r0..r95 are 96 distinct entries, no mod-64 aliasing). The r96 memory-index fault is positive
  evidence that 96 is a *hard* boundary, not a compiler policy cap.
- **16-bit halves are independently addressable, packed 2 per GPR** (64 `half` values → 50 GPRs).
  Native-half access is via the `0x10`/`0x11` groups; the `0x09` 32-bit form's size bit reaches only the
  low half.
- **Register-field widths:** the 6-byte `falu2` dst is a 4-bit nibble (r0–r15 compaction); high float dst
  uses the 8-byte `falu3` form (`dst=byte+1`, 7-bit; r64 observed). Integer `dst=b3` and all source
  fields are 7-bit `(reg<<1)|size` (span r0–r127, covering the 96-reg file).
- **Uniform register file:** a source operand selects **GPR vs uniform**. For the **float `0x09`** ALU there
  are **TWO valid uniform-source encodings, one per operand position** — the compiler picks by which operand
  is the uniform (they are commutation variants of `a + p.k`). *Both are HW-validated; neither supersedes the
  other* (RT-7 corrects the earlier "byte+2-bit4 was wrong/superseded" claim — that framing was itself wrong):
  - **uniform as srcB** (`falu2` srcB form, e.g. `09 01 0c 0d 00 c2`): the select is **byte+2 bit4 + byte+5 bit1**
    (toggling *either* → the GPR is read instead, i.e. 0; bit39 is irrelevant here). Uniform index = byte+3.
    This is what the compiler emits for the exact `struct P{float k}; a[gid]+p.k` kernel (no-fast-math).
  - **uniform as srcA** (`falu2_uni`, e.g. `09 0d 14 01 80 c0`): the select is **bit39 = byte+4 bit7**
    (toggling → GPR read = 0; byte+2 bit4 / byte+5 bit1 are irrelevant here). Uniform index = byte+1 as
    `(ureg<<1)|size`. Emitted when the uniform is srcA (operand order `p.k+a`, or fast-math commuting `a+p.k`).
    When bit39 is set, byte+1's **exponent nibble** disambiguates this uniform source from a packed minifloat
    immediate (`falu2i`): **exp ≥ 8** (instr bit15 = 1) = minifloat immediate, **exp < 8** = uniform source.
  Both HW-read the *runtime* uniform (bind value 7→7, 55→55, 1000→1000). For the **int `0x9f`** ALU the uniform
  form is still byte-diff-inferred (uniform-srcB byte+5 bit4, uniform-srcA byte+6). `uniform_mov` (4 B,
  `Xb YY 01 08`) copies uniform→GPR. ≤128 uniform regs (7-bit index); exact count ⏳ (only *referenced*
  uniforms occupy uniform registers — on-demand / Dynamic-Caching allocation, so sweeping the index surfaces
  only the one bound uniform).
- **Footprint declaration:** the exact GPR/scratch/uniform/threadgroup footprint is in the shader
  binary's own `__GPU_METADATA` FlatBuffer (field 0 = GPR count, 14/41 = scratch bytes, 31 = uniform,
  9 = threadgroup) — this is *our own* compiled shader's metadata (OWN-SHADER). The launch-descriptor
  `+0x00` config word carries only a coarse **2-level occupancy tier** (bit 23). The tier bit is real
  (clear at low footprint, set at high), but the exact **"2-tier by PEAK register pressure (EXP-M4-09/CMD-8: f0=8 appears on both sides, lowest SET at f0=5) — the earlier "clear ≤11 / set ≥12 GPRs" threshold is
  INTERPOLATED, not measured** (RT-7): EXP-0020's config correlation only captured **f0=8 (clear)** and
  **f0=14 (set)** — the 11-vs-12 transition is an interpolation between those two points, never a directly
  observed 11→12 flip. Treat the precise threshold as unverified.
- **Dynamic Caching / spill:** above 96 GPRs the compiler spills to **per-thread scratch (stack)** memory
  (scratch size in `__GPU_METADATA`); spilled kernels (80–256 regs) compute correctly. A compiler must
  know: 96 GPRs before spill (a hard boundary — r96+ faults, above), 2 halves/GPR, scratch cost, and the
  occupancy tier bit (exact GPR threshold interpolated). ⏳ the scratch-base location is a follow-up.

### ✅ Packed float immediate = 8-bit minifloat (HARDWARE-VALIDATED, EXP-0006)
When srcB imm mode (bit 39) is set, srcB byte encodes an **8-bit minifloat** (NOT IEEE-754):
`[exp:4 (bits 7:4, bias 11)][mant:3 (bits 3:1)][flag:1 (bit 0 = 1)]`, sign at instruction bit 19.
- normal (exp ≥ 9): `value = (1 + mant/8) · 2^(exp−11)`
- subnormal (exp = 8): `value = (mant/8) · 2^−2`
- representable magnitudes: `{0, 1/32 … 30.0}`; out-of-range / non-dyadic constants fall back to a
  register-load form. Worked examples: `1.0→0xb1`, `2.0→0xc1`, `1.5→0xb9`, `3.5→0xcd`,
  `0.0625→0x85`, `30.0→0xff` (max). All 16 tested constants spliced and produced exact `a+K`.
- **Domain (RT-1a-FIX):** the minifloat is only valid for **exponent field e ≥ 8**. The `e < 8` byte range
  is NOT an immediate — it is the **uniform-register source overload** (`falu2_uni`, above). `imm_decode()`
  is now **guarded** to `e ≥ 8` (it raises rather than silently extrapolating a bogus tiny value into the
  uniform range — the old unguarded code returned `a + imm_decode(0x0d) ≈ a + 0.00085` for what is really a
  uniform read).

### ✅ Integer ALU family (EXP-0007)
Integer ops are **spread across several byte0 groups** (each its own format), mirroring the float
split — there is **no single unified integer op-select**. For `iadd`/`isub`, **byte0 bit7 is the
ADD/SUBTRACT selector** (RT-1a-FIX HW-re-validated, corrects the earlier inverted `srcA_neg`): the
compiler emits **`0x9f` for a plain ADD** and **`0x1f` for a SUBTRACT**, and splicing a real add's
byte0 `0x9f`→`0x1f` turns `10+20` into `10−20 = −10` on hardware. (The DB previously matched the
canonical iadd on `0x1f` with `srcA_neg=0` / semantics `d=srcA+srcB`, although `0x1f` subtracts —
now fixed: the descriptor field is `addsub` with enum `1`=iadd/`0`=isub.)

| byte0 | len | operation(s) | op-select | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x9f`/`0x1f` | 10 | iadd / isub | `b0 bit7` = **add(1,`0x9f`) / sub(0,`0x1f`)** | ✅ HW (RT-1a-FIX) |
| `0x9f`/`0x1f` | 12 | imul / imad | 3-source multiply-add (imul = imad, c=0) | ✅ HW (behaviour) |
| `0x?2` (lo-nibble 2) | 6/8/10/14 | imin/imax/umin/umax, compare→select, carry, coord/madd | **byte0 hi-nibble = dst reg**; length keyed on byte+2 op-select (see below) | ✅ HW |
| `0x0b` | 10 | iand/ior/ixor | `b2[0:4]` + `b4/b5` src-invert | ⏳ toggle/byte-diff |
| `0xa7` | 10/12 | shift-right / bitfield-extract | multi-instr for reg shifts | ⏳ byte-diff |
| `0x27` | 8/10/12 | popcount / unary / convert / shift-prep / matrix-load-prep | byte+1 form (`0x02`=12B matrix prep) | ⏳ byte-diff |

- **Integer length rule:** for `0x9f`/`0x1f`/`0xa7`, the 10-vs-12-byte selector is **byte +1 bit 0**
  (contrast the float group's byte +2 bit 1). Tokenizes all 26 integer shaders with 0 leftover.
- **Operand encoding (differs from float):** **dst = `b3`** as `(reg<<1)|size` (float dst was
  `b0[4:8]`) — the wider field leaves room for **>16 registers**; srcA/srcB packed in the `b7:b8:b9`
  tail (`(reg<<1)` convention, exact widths a follow-up).
- **Integer immediate = `(K<<1)`**, a **multi-byte little-endian** field starting at `b5` (K=1→0x02,
  127→0xfe, 128→0x0100 spanning b5/b6). **CORRECTION (EXP-M4-10 ISA-4):** it stays **INLINE at least
  to 65536** (K∈{256,512,1024,65536} all keep the same instruction length) — the earlier "≥256
  materializes to a register" was wrong. Negative immediates switch the op byte0 (`0x9f`→`0x1f`
  subtract)/sign path, not a register materialization. **Not** the float minifloat encoding.
- Note: a load/store opcode-keying bug was fixed here (`0x67`/`0xe7` exact, was low-nibble `0x7`
  which collided with `0xa7`/`0x27`).

- **✅ The `0x?2` (low-nibble-2) INTEGER COMPARE / MIN-MAX / SELECT / CARRY group is ONE family
  whose byte0 HIGH nibble is the DESTINATION register (r0..r15)** — exactly like the low-nibble-9
  float ALU (EXP-M4-01, M4/A18 census). **HW-VALIDATED:** on `o=max(a,b)` (a single `02 01 1e 05 06 c0`
  iminmax writing r0, then stored), splicing byte0 `0x02→0x12` (dst r1) or `0x02→0x42` (dst r4) makes
  the result land in a different register while the store still reads r0 ⇒ output flips `10,20,…,80`→
  all-zeros, and the dispatch runs `STATUS OK` (so `0x12`/`0x42` are *valid* encodings, not faults).
  The DB previously hard-coded only dst r0..r3 (`0x02`/`0x12`/`0x22`/`0x32`) and left every
  higher-register form (`0x42,0x52,0x62,0x72,0x82,0x92,0xa2,0xb2,0xc2,0xd2,…`) UNDECODED — the single
  largest source of census resync cascades. The op and length are selected by the **byte+2 op-select**
  (every op-select is `≤ 0x3f`; a larger byte+2 is an operand tail, so it is never mis-lengthed):

  | byte+2 op-select | len | operation | evidence (anchored gap) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `0x1e,0x2e,0x3e, 0x26,0x36` | 6 | iminmax (min/max/median/clamp) | i_max, mm3 |
  | `0x35` | 6 | `carry_gen` (u64 add carry-out) | l_add |
  | `0x3d` | 6 | fcmp→predicate (feeds a psel) | k_int_arith `42 0d 3d` (EXP-M4-01 r2) |
  | `0x23` | 6 | SFU polynomial fma (exp/log/pow Horner step, feeds a sel) | k_transcend `42 81 23` (EXP-M4-01 r2) |
  | `0x1d` | 14 | icmpsel (compare → 0/1 const-select) | i_cmp |
| `0x2d` | **10** | icmpsel, register-operand form — **byte+2 is the discriminator, corrected 2026-08-30 (EXP-0200/0212)**. Every HW-validated 14-byte instance carries byte+2 `0x1d`; both 10-byte hardware sites carry `0x2d`. The length is **context-dependent and `db.json`'s single `icmpsel.length` integer cannot express it**, so a blanket 14 → 10 was refused and only this narrow form applied. | k_uint_arith@0x134 |
  | low-nibble-1 group, byte+2 `(b2 & 0xc7)` = `0x04`/`0x05` | 8 | native bfloat ALU — **mask corrected 2026-08-30 (EXP-0216)**. The op-select is byte+2 bits **[2:0]** (`100` add / `101` mul / `110` fma); bits [5:3] are NOT part of it. Hardware accepted **eight** byte+2 values (`0x04, 0x0c, 0x14, 0x1c, 0x24, 0x2c, 0x34, 0x3c`) with **bit-identical output**, and the old gate sized only `0x1c`. Widening is **strictly additive**: 21 encodings gained a length, none was reassigned. | EXP-0171 NAT carrier |
| low-nibble-1 group, byte+2 `(b2 & 0xc7)` = `0x06` | 10 | same group, fma select | |
| `0x27`/`0x2f`, byte+3`==0x80`, **byte+4 bit1 (0x02) set** | 10 | coordinate / integer-madd `dst=a*b+c`, WIDE srcC (+ trailing 16-bit operand word) | s_div, k_int64@230 |
  | `0x27`/`0x2f`, byte+3`==0x80`, **byte+4 bit1 clear** | 8 | same madd, narrow srcC | k_cf_switch@78, k_int_bitcount@72/@98 (EXP-M4-01 r2) |
  | `0x27`, byte+3`==0x81`&byte+4`==0x22` | 10 | `rt_transform_test` | (EXP-O2C) |
  | `0x27`, else | 8 | quotient / wide-select (incl. dst `0x22`) | u_div, k_cf_if |

  | byte+2 **> 0x3f** (not a valid op-select) | — | NOT this op: greedy `→6` was gated off (EXP-M4-01 r2) so a compact op / resync landing is not mis-lengthed and does not eat the following op | k_transcend, k_tex_array_cube |

  (A predicate-producing compare that feeds a *separate* `0x05` psel keeps the 6-byte form — its
  byte+3 low-nibble is `4`, e.g. gsel4/dsel5 `02 03 07 84`.) All lengths are fixed by **anchored
  segmentation**: the gap between two high-confidence anchors (get_sr / load / store / cvt / iadd /
  imad / stop) equals the sum of the enclosed op lengths.

- **Compact 4-byte float ALU (byte0 low-nibble 9, byte+2 arith-enable bit `0x04` clear):** the
  division/sqrt refinement emits a 4-byte accumulate/move form; byte+2 ∈ `{0x18,0x38,0x19,0x21,0x31}`
  (extends the EXP-0025 `0x18/0x38` set). Confirmed by anchored `cvt..cvt` gaps (s_div@136 `79 8d 21 97`,
  t_sqrt@28 `09 05 19 01`).

- **Other length-rule fixes closing census gaps (EXP-M4-01):** `0x27` byte+1`==0x02` is a **12-byte
  matrix-load-prep** form (k_matrix; the old rule dropped it to 8B and exposed the tail as a spurious
  `0xf0` group); byte0 `0x2c`/byte+1`==0x0c` is a **4-byte compact move** (s_div); the low-nibble-3
  group with byte+2`==0x27` is a distinct **10-byte** op (`33 8a 27 bf …`, transcend/tex); byte0
  low-nibble-0/8 with byte+2`==0x24` is the **6-byte packed-half2 ALU** (k_half2_pack, distinct from the
  `0x10` scalar native-half ALU and the `0x18` half_pack). Net effect on the M4 own-shader census:
  distinct UNDECODED byte0 groups **28 → 19**, byte coverage **91.5% → 93.4%**, with **no per-kernel
  regression**; the residue is concentrated in `k_tex_atomic` (interleaved variable-length `0x0f`
  control-flow mask ops — a documented follow-up — plus texture-atomic ops) and the remaining
  transcendental range-reduction helpers.

- **✅ EXP-M4-01 (round 2) — the census residue was GENUINE instruction gaps, not `0x0f` CF.**
  Round 1 left the `0x0f` execution-mask family flagged as an unresolved variable-length follow-up.
  **That was stale:** `instr_length` already lengths every `0x0f` sub-op (`00`/`01` jump 10B, `04`
  mask_op 4B, `05` if_push 4B / direct-CALL 14B, `06` pop_reconverge 6B, `80` computed-branch 6B),
  and the whole-corpus walk decodes all 67 `0x0f` occurrences in-sequence. The real residue was a set
  of genuinely-missing ops and length-polymorphism bugs, now closed:
  - **`icmp_pred` is a dst-register family (byte0 LOW nibble `0xa`, HIGH nibble = predicate reg).**
    HW-VALIDATED by splice (`k_iso_icmp2`, a loop with `break`/`continue`): splicing a loop-guard
    compare byte0 `0x2a→0x0a` moved its predicate p2→p0 (out `4,25,110,110`→`133,25,133,133`) and
    `0x2a→0x4a` moved it p2→p4 (`→4,389,9989`), both `STATUS OK` — i.e. the high nibble selects the
    destination predicate register, exactly like the `0x?2` sibling. The old `b0==0x0a` rule left every
    `0x1a/0x2a/0x3a/0x9a/0xca` UNDECODED (the dominant `k_tex_atomic`/`k_uint_arith`/`k_int64` desync).
    6 bytes; byte+2 is the compare op-select (`0x22/23/25/2b/35/39/3a`, all `≤ 0x3f`).
  - **madd length is keyed on byte+4 bit1, for byte+2 `0x27` AND `0x2f`** (see table above): the
    srcC descriptor's bit1 (`0x02`) selects a wide srcC carrying a trailing 16-bit operand word (10B)
    vs narrow (8B). Separates every corpus occurrence cleanly and now applies to dst `0x22` too (the
    old `0x22` baseline forced 10 and ate the following op, exposing a spurious `0x54` group).
  - **`0xa7` byte+1`==0x17` is an 8-byte convert** (sibling of the `0x07` int→float; k_cvt_fi/k_cvt_half),
    not the 10-byte `ashr`; the old odd→10 rule ate the following `a7 07` cvt.
  - **Extended-source vertex fma (byte0 lo-nibble 9, byte+2 `0x26`/`0x2e`, byte+4`==0x82`, byte+6/+7
    `42 02`) is 10 bytes** with a trailing `00 <slot>` varying/output-slot word (every VS: r_basic_v/
    r_deriv_v/r_tex_v). Fixing it took **render:vertex to 100%** on the A18 corpus.
  - **Fragment derivative (`37 xx 54`, 10B) vs COMPUTE texture-gradient (`37 xx 80`, 8B)** disambiguated
    on byte+2; the 8B compute form is followed by a 12-byte `27 00 54 .. f0 13 01 00` ibfe in the
    software texture-coordinate atomic path.
  - **COMPUTE scoreboard-fence high-scope variants** `87 02 00 00` / `80 02 00 00` (4B, byte0 = `0x07`
    fence with the high bit set; gate the full form on byte+2`==0x00` so a bare `80 02`/`87 02` before a
    CF op is not mis-lengthed). Plus the compact ops `18 00`, `2b 35`/`0b 35` (texture coord/LOD
    selector before `37 xx 80`), `00 8c`, `80 04` (2B compact moves), and the `0x?b` shift/rotate
    compact `?b .. {1c,3c} <amt>` (4B).
  - **Greedy `02`/`0a` gate:** `b0==0x02`/lo-nibble-`0xa` now return 6 **only when byte+2 ≤ 0x3f** (a
    real op-select); a byte+2 > 0x3f means it is a compact op / resync landing, so the op no longer
    greedily eats the following `fspecial`/`coord_madf` (k_transcend, k_tex_array_cube).

  **Net (M4 own-shader census):** distinct UNDECODED byte0 groups **19 → 12**, byte coverage
  **93.4% → 96.4%**, cleanly-tokenized tokens **91.4% → 95.2%**, resync regions **101 → 57**, still
  **0 per-kernel regression** (all 23 previously-100% kernels stay 100%, 9 more reach 100%). A18
  cross-check (same ISA): **93.2% → 96.0%**, groups **20 → 13**, regions **112 → 70**. `roundtrip_test`
  stays **GREEN**. The remaining ≈57 regions are a *characterized* long tail — dense-code compact
  2-byte helper ops (`00 8c`-class), the `0x54` texture-address/imageblock op family (variable
  4/6/8/10-byte, byte+2`==0x03`), threadgroup-memory atomic ops (`k_atomics_tg`: `0b 00 06`, `54 .. 44`),
  cube-array coordinate math (`k_tex_array_cube`), and low-frequency SFU polynomial helpers
  (`k_transcend`) — each a named op needing per-op HW isolation, **not** a resync-cascade artifact.

### ✅ Control flow, predication & program structure (EXP-0010)
- **Preamble = get-special-register** (`get_sr`, byte0 low-nibble `0xC`, 4B): materializes special
  registers into a GPR. **(Corrected by EXP-0031: the SR number is in `byte1`; the byte0 high nibble is
  the destination GPR — not the SR-select.)** See the SR-enum + ABI section below. There is also a 2-byte
  **`mov_imm`** (byte0 low-nibble `0xC`, byte1 = imm8) sharing the nibble.
- **Simple divergence is predication, not branches.** `if/else`/ternary/early-return compile to
  **compare → per-lane execution mask → masked op / select** (no jump). Compare producers: `0x0a`
  (6B, control predicate) and `0x02` (6B, feeds a select); compare immediate at **byte+3**. Selects:
  `0x05`/`0x16` (4B). Proven: splicing the compare immediate moves the active-lane boundary; flipping
  flipping `0x0a`↔`0x02` swaps predicate-vs-select producer (RT-1b: a *naive* byte0 swap MALFORMS output — the two have different operand layouts; true condition inversion is via the **byte+4 compare-mode/negate** field).
- **Loops use a real backward jump:** `0f 00 54 <off6> 00` (10B), `off6` = **signed little-endian
  byte-relative offset**, target = `jump_addr + 4 + off6`. Zeroing the back-edge → contained infinite-loop
  hang (proves it's the taken edge). Fixed-count loops are fully **unrolled**.
- **✅ The `0x0f` execution-mask family is now fully decoded (RT-ISA-FIX, HW-validated).** `0x0f` is the
  control-flow / execution-mask group; **byte+1 selects the sub-op** — each now has a length rule + descriptor
  in `agx-isa`, so if/else/while/for/break/continue/nested-divergence shaders **tokenize cleanly** (0 of 42
  `0x0f` ops undecoded across a for/while/nested/break/continue corpus):
  | byte+1 | mnemonic | len | role |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `0x00` | `jump` | 10 | unconditional PC-relative jump (loop back-edge / block skip) |
  | `0x01` | `jump_cond` | 10 | **conditional** PC-relative jump — the `else`-skip / `while`/`for` loop-exit guard |
  | `0x05` | `if_push` | 4 | execution-mask **push** (enter divergent region); byte+2 0x54 outer / 0x04 inner |
  | `0x06` | `pop_reconverge` | 6 | mask **pop** / **reconverge** (block/loop end); byte+3 = level |
  | `0x80` | `call_indirect` | 6 | computed-target branch (indirect call / break-to-exit) |
  | `0x04` | `mask_op` | 4 | inner mask op in deep nesting (continue-edge re-mask; ⏳ inferred, 1 occurrence) |

  Same shape, the `0x8f` sibling (byte0 = `0x80|0x0f`) is a 4-byte **CF merge/reconverge** marker
  (`8f 04/05 54 ..`) at if/else and loop joins — the same op as a function `ret` (`8f 02/12 54`) with a
  different byte+1. HW splice evidence: corrupting the `0f 00` back-edge offset → `CMDBUF_ERROR`; corrupting a
  `0f 06` reconverge (byte+1 `0x06→0x00`) → `CMDBUF_ERROR`; turning the `0f 01` guard unconditional
  (byte+1 `0x01→0x00`) makes **every lane skip the loop body → all-zero output** (proving 0f 00 = uncond,
  0f 01 = cond). See `experiments/RT-ISA-FIX/`.
- **Program termination:** `0e000000` is **not** a required terminator (splicing it is a no-op); the HW
  stops after the last real instruction — **program length is out-of-band (section/pipeline metadata)**,
  the final `device_store` is the last effective instruction. A `0f 06 …` reconverge word follows
  predicated blocks (block-end, not shader-end).

### ✅ How uniforms & buffer pointers reach registers (EXP-0010)
- **Buffer base pointers are preloaded into a uniform/binding slot**, selected by **`device_load`
  byte+4** (HW-proven: splicing the slot changes which bound buffer is read). The pointer is *not* in
  the shader code (consistent with EXP-0001's negative result) and *not* in the constant_program — it
  is supplied by the command stream / USC (see `../cmdstream/`).
- **Scalar uniforms** (`constant T&`) are preloaded into a **uniform register** read directly by the
  ALU (no `device_load` emitted). ⟶ There *is* a uniform register file, surfaced here as source slots;
  its full addressing is a follow-up (ties into Dynamic Caching).
- The `_agc.main.constant_program` prolog is the **"uniform program"** (EXP-0020): a separate
  uniform/scalar datapath that `device_load`s the uniform buffers and runs the uniform ALU to compute
  **thread-invariant** expressions, leaving results in uniform registers (read directly by the main
  program). This resolves its earlier "advisory prolog" mystery.

### ✅ MOV / select / uniform-move families — emitter rules (EXP-0140) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (dense splice sweeps, two gated captures), `target: G16G`
(local Apple M4). Source: `experiments/EXP-0140-m4-emit-mov-cf/RESULTS.md`.
**11 of 23 dispatched instructions moved from "decodable" to EMITTABLE** (3 → 14 of 23):
`get_sr`, `mov_imm`, `psel`, `sel`, `uniform_mov`, `reg_move_c0/c1/c2var/c9/cb`, `if_push`.

**`uniform_mov.usrc` (byte+1) is a two-region field — and its upper half is a second way to
materialise a constant.**

| `usrc` | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `≥ 0x80` | **materialises the immediate `usrc & 0x7F`** into the destination GPR — a 7-bit immediate move, *not* a uniform read. **128/128** immediate-region values matched a host-computed oracle exactly. |
| `< 0x80` | selects a uniform register, **pair-quantised**: `usrc` and `usrc ^ 1` read the same 32-bit word, and consecutive uniforms step by 4. **8/8** of the indices holding our four bound magic constants returned them exactly (`0x18/0x19`→u0, `0x1C/0x1D`→u1, `0x20/0x21`→u2, `0x24/0x25`→u3). Buffer base addresses were observed at `usrc` `0x00/0x01` and `0x04/0x05`; **unallocated uniform indices return a silent zero.** |

So an emitter now has **two independent ways to materialise a small constant**: `mov_imm`
(7-bit, r0..r15) and the `0x?B` family with `usrc ≥ 0x80` (7-bit, r0..r15). The latter was
previously documented as a uniform-register read only.

> ⚠️ **"Emittable" here does NOT mean a general GPR→GPR move exists.** Under `DOC-02` a family is
> emittable when every emitter-filled field is `hardware-run` or `isolated-byte-diff` — which this
> family now satisfies for its **immediate** and **uniform-register** source classes. It says
> nothing about moving from a GPR written by a preceding computation, which remains the open hard
> negative documented in [`register-move-and-liveness.md`](register-move-and-liveness.md) §1.0
> (EXP-0090's scope correction: EXP-0087's validated cases were **entirely
> uniform-register-sourced**). Do not read this section as closing `nir_op_mov`.

The rest of that cluster: **`dst`** (byte0 high nibble) — all 16 values write r_D and nothing
else. **byte+2** moves a value exactly when `(v & 0xCB) == 0x01` (8 of 256 values).
**byte+3** moves a value exactly when `(v & 0x0E) == 0x08` (32 of 256 values).

> **`db.json` defect (recorded, not patched here):** `reg_move_c0` / `c1` / `c2var` / `c9` /
> `cb` / `uniform_mov` are **ONE instruction, not six** — a single 256-value sweep of byte+2 in
> one carrier shows the five "descriptors" are five values of one 8-bit form field. `db.json`'s
> split of byte+1 into `src_reg` + `src_flag` also does not match hardware: **bit 7 is the
> immediate-vs-uniform-file selector**, not a register-file half flag.

**⚠️ RETRACTION — `mov_imm`'s "silent zero" was a zero-initialised buffer (EXP-0140 corrects
EXP-0128).** EXP-0128 reported that `mov_imm` immediates 128..255 "silently zero" the
destination. That reading was taken against a **zero-initialised read-back buffer**. Against a
**poisoned** buffer the paired control settles it:

- with `imm_top = 1` the instruction **does not write the destination register at all** — the
  destination keeps its previous value (7, not 0) when 4 bytes of inert padding follow it;
- **unpadded, it consumes the following 2-byte instruction**, so the read-back store addresses
  the wrong word.

**Bit 7 selects a different, longer instruction. It neither extends the immediate nor zeroes.**
EXP-0128's *conclusion* — treat the immediate as **7 bits** — stands; its *mechanism* does not.
`mov_imm.dst` is `hardware-run` 16/16: every value 0..15 wrote only r_D, confirmed by four
independent 12-register aliasing scans.

> **Decoder defect, not a hardware claim:** `mov_imm` with `imm7 == 12` does not tokenize under
> the current length rule (byte+1 = `0x0C` makes the 2-byte pair look like the 4-byte `0x?c`
> preamble group). It is the only immediate in 0..127 with this property, checked exhaustively
> over all 16 `dst` values. Whether the hardware agrees was **not tested**; every immediate
> EXP-0140 emitted avoids 12.

**`get_sr` — the two "opaque" bytes are not don't-cares.** Oracle: grid=8/tg=8, a working
`thread_position_in_grid.x` read makes each lane store its own index.

| field | reads the SR correctly iff | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `form` | 0 or 1 | **both inert** |
| `dp_width` | `(v & 0xD3) == 0x10` | bits 0,1,6,7 clear, bit 4 set; bits 2,3,5 don't-care. **Faults on 32 of 256 values**; silently returns the wrong vector on 216. |
| `dp_marker` | `(v & 0xE6) == 0x06` | bits 1,2 set, bits 5,6,7 clear; bits 0,3,4 don't-care. Wrong vector on the other 24. |

**`sel.body` is three located byte-fields, not one opaque 24-bit `raw`.**

- **byte+3 = the predicate-FALSE operand.** With bit 7 set it is an **8-bit immediate whose
  value is the byte itself** (128..255) — matched a host-computed oracle on **510 of 512** cases
  (the other 2 were environmental faults). With bit 7 clear it selects an operand that read 0 in
  this carrier. Independently confirmed statically against five authored `?:` variants:
  `(a>5)?130:250` compiles to `16 c2 a0 fa` (0xFA = 250) and `(a>5)?100:200` to `16 c2 a0 c8`.
- **byte+2** splits into four 64-value classes: 128 inert, 128 wrong value, 128 silent zero,
  **127 fault**.
- **byte+1** is the predicate/operand source selector: only 4 values (194, 198, 202, 206) are
  inert; 248 silently zero and 256 return a different value.

**`psel`** has the same structure: `sel` (byte+3) **512/512 matched the oracle** with the
identical immediate model; `mode` (byte+2) inert exactly when `(v & 0xC0) == 0x00` (64 values,
127 values **fault**); `flag` (byte+1) inert exactly when `(v & 0x12) == 0x02`.

**Control-flow bytes an emitter may fill freely, measured inert across all 256 values** in a
program whose oracle proves the branch and the mask stack executed: `if_push.scope`,
`if_push_pred.scope`, `jump.link`, `jump.branch_ctrl`, `pop_reconverge.scope`. Load-bearing in
the same family: `if_push.scope_kind` (64 values inert, 178 wrong value, 1 hang);
`pop_reconverge.scope_kind = 0` is the single fatal value; `ret.linkmode` runs **only when
`(v & 7) == 4`** — the other 224 values fault.

**What EXP-0140 does NOT establish (`UNKNOWN`, deliberately):**

- **`jump_cond`'s three fields stay `untested`.** Every structured offset — including targets
  that are not instruction starts and targets *outside the program* — reproduced the baseline,
  and so did all 256 values of `cf_scope` and `reserved`. The carrier is structurally powerless:
  `jump_cond` is the loop-entry guard and the only lane whose guard is true has trip count 0, so
  both paths compute the same value. **EXP-0115's branch reach was measured on `jump` and does
  not transfer to `jump_cond`.**
- `mask_op`, `ret_luse`, `call`, `call_indirect` were **not swept at all**.
- `ret.scoreboard` and `if_push_pred.level` were stopped by the two-hang budget.
- **Methodological caution:** *lengthening a control-flow carrier is not semantically neutral*,
  even when the documented `base_slot` trap is avoided — adding arithmetic on an accumulator
  alone (no new buffer reference) moved the constant the reused skeleton's select compares
  against, so every lane took the TRUE arm, while every `base_slot` value stayed identical.

### ✅ Memory access family (EXP-0012)
Device & threadgroup load/store share opcodes `0x67` (load) / `0xe7` (store), 14 bytes:

| byte | field | meaning | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| +0 | opcode | `0x67` load / `0xe7` store | ✅ |
| +1 | **space** | address-space selector: nonzero low bits (`0x01`/`0x02`) = threadgroup / uninitialized (reads 0), `0x00` = device/global/constant. **NOT the index register** (RT-1a corrected the old "higher bits = index GPR") | ✅ |
| +3 | extmode | bit1 = unsigned/zero-extend variant | ⏳ |
| +4 | **base_slot** | preloaded buffer-base uniform slot (0=buf0, 1=buf1, …) | ✅ |
| +5 | **index_reg** | **the GPR that supplies the array index `a[idx]`** — low bits = register number, bit7 (`0x80`) = a scalar/size flag. (RT-1a: this is NOT `count`; sweeping it selects which GPR feeds the index: `0x00`→r0, `0x01`→r1, …). **EXP-M4-10 (ISA-1):** splicing +5=`0xff` (r127) **hard-FAULTS** (`CMDBUF_ERROR`) — proof the high bits are real register-select bits, **not** masked mod-64. | ✅ |
| +6 | **inert** | HW-proven padding — sweeping `0x00`..`0xff` never changes the loaded value; not an address byte | ✅ |
| +8 | dst / (load-only) reg + width | **LOAD:** destination GPR + data width (`51`=32b `(reg<<1)|is32`, `41`=16b, `61`=8b, `59`=64b), splice-confirmed (EXP-M4-10 ISA-1: changing it breaks the consumer). **STORE — CORRECTION (EXP-M4-10 ISA-1):** +8 is **HW-INERT** for `device_store` (two scalar stores of distinct regs both had +8=`0x11`; splicing +8 does nothing). The stored **data GPR is byte+2/+3-region** (amode 0x54: +3 low bits = data reg), **not** +8 and **not** symmetric with the load dst; exact position is amode-dependent (byte-diff, not fully pinned). | ✅ load / ⚠️ store reg |
| +9 bit7 / +10 / +11 | **idx_off** | in-instruction additive **immediate element index-offset**: +9 bit7 = +1, +10 = +2/unit, +11 low bits = +512/unit (RT-1a) | ✅ |
| +12 | **elem_size** | address element size, bits[1:4]=k → `2^(k-1)` bytes (`42`=1,`44`=2,`46`=4,`48`=8) | ✅ |

- **Addressing model: element addressing with an optional immediate offset.** Effective byte address =
  `(index_GPR + idx_off) × element_size`, where **index_GPR = byte+5** and **idx_off** is the additive
  immediate element-offset field (byte+9 bit7 / +10 / +11; RT-1a-FIX HW-validated: idxbuf i0=40 →
  byte+9=`0x81`→a[41], byte+10=`0x01`→a[42]/`0x08`→a[56], byte+11=`0x41`→a[552]). The **compiler leaves
  idx_off = 0** and instead computes `a[i+k]` / `a[i*s]` by a **prior integer ALU op** on the index (so
  `a[gid+1/+2/+4]`, `a[gid*2/*4]` all share a byte-identical load, the offset living in the preceding
  `iadd` immediate — EXP-0012), **but the hardware offset field exists** and a driver may use it directly.
- **Vectors:** `float4`/`int4` = one load + one store moving 4 words (`count`=4 at +5).
- **Sign extension:** signed sub-32-bit loads are **sign-extended by a following ALU shift** (`0xa7`),
  not by the load; unsigned use the zero-extend load variant (byte+3 bit1). HW-validated.
- **Threadgroup memory:** same `0x67`/`0xe7` with byte+1 = `0x02` (address-space selector) and
  base_slot `0x08` (local); lid-derived offset. (The vtx/frag `0x07/0x87/0x97/0xa7` groups are *not*
  threadgroup memory.)
- **Constant address space** (`constant T*` indexing) is **byte-identical** to a device load — the
  device/constant distinction is not in the ISA (it's in the binding). Scalar `constant T&` stays a
  preloaded uniform-register read (no load), per EXP-0010.
- **Atomics** are in the **memory family** (byte0 `0x67`) as **native single-RMW ops** — see the
  Atomics section below. (Corrects EXP-0012's initial guess of a "`0xbf` CAS loop": `0xbf` is actually
  the SIMD-reduce op, and the surrounding `0f05`/`0f06` are elect-one-lane predication, not a retry loop.)
- **What byte address a load/store actually touches once misaligned or out-of-allocation** (per-unit
  align-down addressing, OOB zero-fill/discard, boundary-straddling behavior; M4/G16G, EXP-0076) is
  documented separately in [`memory-model.md`](memory-model.md) — a normative chapter, not covered here.

### ✅ Memory-family operand rules an emitter must follow (EXP-0141) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (exhaustive splice sweeps, ~71,000 GPU measurements, 4 gated
runs), `target: G16G` (local Apple M4). Source:
`experiments/EXP-0141-m4-emit-mem/RESULTS.md`. This is what took `device_load`, `device_store`
and `threadgroup_barrier` from "decodable" to **emittable** (emitter-grade fields 246 → 288;
emittable instructions 7 → 10 of 171 at that point in the wave). The full normative statement,
with ranges and fallbacks, is [`memory-model.md` §2A](memory-model.md); the register-lifetime
context is [`register-move-and-liveness.md`](register-move-and-liveness.md).

- **Destination register rule (supersedes the EXP-M4-13 formula that EXP-0101 retracted).**
  `dst_lo`/`dst_ext9` carry **no register information**. To land a load in register `R`:
  `extmode = 2·R` (**bit 0 is a don't-care**), `dst_lo = 1` **exactly**, `dst_ext9` **bit 0 = 1**
  — three constrained bits of the nine those fields span. **`extmode` 0..127 all match and
  128..255 all fail**, so `R` is reachable only for **`R = 0..63`; `R ≥ 64` silently zeroes**
  through this field. Identical at r3/r7/r20/r33 and under all 21 working `ld_format` codes.
- **The atomic RMW operand register is ENCODED, not implicit.** `db.json` said "implicit
  (supplied by the preceding op / amode)" and `DOC-02` ranked it MISSING. It is carried in
  **byte+5 bit 7 plus byte+6 bits 0..5**:
  `index = (byte+5 >> 7) | ((byte+6 & 0x3F) << 1)`. Proven at all four constructible indices with
  the redirected register **released** (a later reader gets 0 — the same contract EXP-0086/0089/
  0099 document), on a **uniform-address** carrier that the old per-lane `index_reg` reading
  cannot explain. The **address** role of byte+5/+6 is not excluded for the per-lane form; the
  **data** role is proven for the uniform form.
- **`device_store` byte+2 bit 1 is a DATA-SOURCE SELECTOR.** It is **inert when the data is
  ALU-computed** (256/256 pass — which is exactly the configuration EXP-0119 measured and
  reported as inert) but **required when the source is a forwarded load**.
- **Five `rsv*` bytes in `atomic_mem`/`atomic_tg` are live and heavily constrained, not
  padding** — only a handful of the 256 values work in each. An emitter must not write arbitrary
  values there.

**Not moved, with reasons (`untested`, honestly scoped):** `mem_fence` ×3 and
`dev_scoreboard_fence.scope_flag` — the carriers have **no ordering observable**, so a pass
proves nothing; `mem_fence8` ×2 — no dispatchable carrier; `atomic_tg.op_desc` — hang budget.

> on new grounds**: on M4 only byte0 `0x1c` works, and EXP-M4-14's A18 `0xfc` does **not**

### ✅ Scalar ALU completion — conversions, fma, unary, transcendentals, bitwise, shift, compare (EXP-0013)
DB now has **24 HW-validated descriptors**. Summary (all HW-validated unless noted):

- **Conversions:** fp32→fp16 = new group **`0x11`** (half-ALU, 6B); fp16→fp32 = ordinary `falu2` with a
  16-bit srcA (the *only* size-bit reuse). float→int = **`0x27`** (10B, **rounds toward zero**);
  int→float = **`0xa7`** (8B). **Signedness for both = byte+7 bit6.** int narrow+sign-ext = `0x9f`;
  zero-extend-16 = **`0x13`** (4B); `int↔uint`/`as_type` bitcast = **no instruction** (free).
- **FMA** (`d=a*b+c`): `0x09` 8-byte form, srcA=byte+3, srcB=byte+4, **srcC=byte+5**.
- **Float unary** (`0x0b`, 10B): byte+5 = `0x00 fmov / 0x02 fabs / 0x0a fneg`.
- **Transcendental/round group** (`0x2f`/`0xaf`, 10B): exp2/log2/floor/ceil/trunc/rint, with a
  **round-mode field at byte+8** (0 nearest, 2 floor, 4 ceil, 6 trunc). frcp/frsqrt/fsqrt/fsin/fcos are
  **multi-instruction Newton-Raphson** (0x29 estimate seed) — ⏳ follow-up.
- **fmin/fmax** (`0x12`, 6B): byte+4 bit0 = min/max. A18 EXP-0013 and
  M4 EXP-0047 compiler-emitted source paths both return the numeric operand for
  tested one-qNaN cases. A18 tested `fmax` and M4 tested both `fmin`/`fmax`
  selecting operand B for signed-zero ties; M4 additionally shows operand-B
  selection for the tested effectively-equal subnormal and both-qNaN cases.
  The prior universal “IEEE minNum/maxNum” shorthand was too strong. The M4
  edge matrix is source-path evidence, not an
  isolated native-op semantic proof.
- **Bitwise** (`ilogic`, `0x0b`): a **full 2-input LUT covering all 16 boolean functions** (selectors
  byte+2 + byte+4/+5 inverts) — covers every Vulkan/GL logic op. See `../hypotheses.md`.
- **Shifts:** arithmetic `>>` imm = `0xa7` 10B (amount = byte+6>>2); logical `>>` imm = `0xa7` 12B
  extract; `<<` imm = `0x9f` 10B; `extract_bits` = `0xa7` 12B. Register-amount shifts are multi-instruction.
- **Compare condition codes** (`0x12` icmpsel, **14B at byte+2 `0x1d`; the byte+2 `0x2d` register-operand form is 10B** — see the length table): byte+6 = `0x02 f> / 0x03 f< / 0x04 u> / 0x05 u< /
  0x06 s> / 0x07 s<` (bits[1:3]=type float/uint/sint, bit0=lt/gt); byte+4 = `0x22 ordered / 0x26 equality`;
  result-negate (ge/le/ne) = byte+5 bit0 + byte+9 bit0. One op handles float and signed/unsigned int.

### ✅ Texture / sample family (EXP-0016)
- **Sample = 14-byte bundle:** a 4-byte coord/result **companion** (`05 80 0c CC`, byte0 low-nibble 5;
  bit5 = chained 2nd tex op) + a 10-byte **sampler op** (byte0 `0xb0`/`0x90`, high nibble = result-reg
  selector). Fields (`op+N`):
  - **variant / dimension / LOD-mode = op+2:** `0x00` sample(implicit-LOD) · `0x04` grad · `0x07` bias ·
    `0x09` level · `0x13` cube · `0x17` 2D read · `0x79` 3D read · `0x97` 2D-array read (bit7=array) ·
    `0x80` MSAA read.
  - **texture-slot = op+4** — the **argument-buffer texture index** (Tier-2 path). ⚠ **CAVEAT (RT-5):**
    under **direct** `setTexture:atIndex:` binding, op+4's low bits are **inert** — only **bit7 (`0x80`)** is
    load-bearing, and it is a 2-way flip (reaches only a 2nd texture; a 3rd bound texture differs in
    companion+3 / op+1, not op+4). op+4 acts as a clean index only through the driver's **Tier-2
    argument-buffer** texture table (see `../cmdstream/`, `../descriptors/`); the direct-binding fast path
    folds it to the bit7 flip. Single-resource shaders always encode slot 0.
  - **sampler-slot = op+5** — HW-validated clean index (splice samp1→samp0 flipped linear→nearest; `0x00`=s0,
    `0x01`=s1, out-of-range → unbound/zeros).
  - **coord = op+1** (+ preceding ALU); result reg = sampler-op byte0 hi + companion byte+3.
  - **op+6 is NOT the filter selector (RT-5):** splicing op+6 `0x10↔0x00↔0x20` on a linear sample is a
    **no-op** — **filtering is controlled by the SAMPLER** (proven via op+5), not op+6. op+6 does carry the
    LOD-*mode* (`0x20` = `calculate_lod` query); explicit-LOD/bias *presence* is op+7 bit2, with the
    LOD/bias/grad *value* coming from a register set up by a preceding ALU op.
- **Texture read** = same sampler op, mode op+2 = `0x17/0x79/0x97/0x80`, no sampler (HW-validated).
- **Texture write = `0xd7`, 16 bytes** — a **memory-family store** (sibling of `0x67`/`0xe7`), *not* the
  sampler path (HW-validated).
- **Texture queries** (`get_width/height/num_mip_levels/num_samples/array_size`) = **no instruction**:
  compile to a preloaded-uniform read; the driver supplies the value from the texture descriptor.
- **Derivatives = `0x37`, 10 bytes** (axis byte+6: `0x92`=dfdx, `0x90`=dfdy). Implicit-LOD sampling does
  *not* emit `0x37` — LOD is computed inside the texture unit; `0x37` is only for source `dfdx/dfdy/fwidth`.
- Slots op+4/op+5 index the Tier-2 argument-buffer texture/sampler tables (see `../cmdstream/`,
  `../descriptors/`); single-resource shaders always encode slot 0.
- ⏳ Follow-ups: result/coord register bit decode; `sample_compare` (depth PCF, distinct companion
  low-nibble `0xd`); array/3D/cube/MSAA index-operand bit positions; derivative fine/coarse.

### ✅ Atomics (EXP-0018)
Atomics are **native single-RMW ops in the memory family** (byte0 `0x67`), *not* CAS loops.
`atomic_rmw` = `67 11 54 00 00 <addr> 42 00 00 <OP> 00` (14 B). **base_slot at byte+4** (same slot model
as loads); **device vs threadgroup = byte+1 bit1** (as in `../isa` memory). **Operation at byte+12**
(HW splice-proven):

| op | code | op | code | op | code |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| add | `0x20` | sub | `0x36` | and | `0x22` |
| or | `0x2c` | xor | `0x3e` | fadd | `0x26` |
| smax | `0x28` | smin | `0x2a` | umax | `0x38` |
| umin | `0x3a` | exchange/store | `0x3c` | cmpxchg | `0x24` |

`cmpxchg` is a single op + a following `icmp` for the bool (no loop). Device atomics to a *uniform*
address get a compiler optimization: SIMD-reduce → one-lane RMW → prefix-broadcast (32 transactions → 1
per simdgroup). Aggregate HW-validated (1024 threads → counter 1024; op-splice add→max → 32).

### ✅ Subgroup / SIMD-group & quad ops (EXP-0018) — SIMD width = 32
- **`simd_reduce`** (byte0 `0xbf`/`0x3f`, 8 B, byte+2=`0x54`/`0x56`): reduce & prefix-scan. Op = (byte0 bit7,
  byte+1); **byte+7 = datatype/shape: `0x03` int-reduce, `0x07` int-minmax, `0x12` float-reduce, `0x09`
  inclusive-scan, `0x0b` exclusive-scan** (byte+2 bit1 is a source cache/last-use hint, 0x54 vs 0x56, not an
  op change). **Prefix-scan is native.** *(RT-ISA-FIX re-proved these on a fresh compile: `simd_sum(int)`=496
  emits byte+7=`0x03`, inclusive-scan `0x09`, exclusive-scan `0x0b` — exactly as decoded here. RT-5's claim
  that "int-reduce=`0x01`/exclusive-scan=`0x09`" did **not** reproduce; splicing byte+7 `0x03→0x01/0x07` left
  the sum=496 unchanged, so the DB enum is correct and unchanged.)*
- **`simd_shuffle`** (byte0 `0x47`/`0xc7`, 10 B, byte+2=`0x54`/`0x56`): broadcast / shuffle(xor/up/down) /
  rotate / dynamic shuffle. byte+1 = simd/quad/rotate; byte+6 = lane/mask as `(value<<1)`. *(RT-ISA-FIX:
  real compiled broadcast/xor carry byte+2=`0x54`; the DB match was relaxed to accept both — `simd_broadcast(v,3)`=35
  and `simd_shuffle_xor(v,3)` HW-re-validated.)*
- **`simd_ballot`** (byte0 `0x17`, 10 B): ballot / active-mask / all / any / is_first. **byte+1 low nibble
  `0x7` identifies the family**; high nibble picks the form — `0x07` = active-mask/any/all, **`0x17` =
  `simd_ballot(predicate)`**. *(RT-ISA-FIX: `simd_ballot(lane<5)`=0x1F HW; the `0x17` form was previously
  mis-decoded as `unpack_convert` — now separated from `unpack_convert` on byte+1 low nibble, ballot=7 vs
  unpack=4. RT-10 confirmed: splicing byte+1 low-nibble `0x17→0x14` zeroes the ballot, proving the low nibble
  is the load-bearing family separator. The **high nibble** (ballot-predicate vs active-mask) is a correct
  naming distinction but is **not cleanly splice-convertible** — its operands co-vary — so treat it as a decode
  label, not an independently-settable field.)*
- **Quad ops** reuse the same two groups at **width 4** (reduce with scope bit3=0 → byte0 `0xb7`/`0x37`;
  shuffle with byte+1=`0x00`). Note `0x37` disambiguates quad-reduce (byte+2=`0x56`, 8 B) from the
  derivative op (10 B).

Capability notes (`../hypotheses.md`): float atomic min/max and 64-bit atomic-add are **not exposed by
MSL** (→ Vulkan must emulate); prefix-scan is native (not a shuffle-tree lowering).

### ✅ Dedicated matrix unit — `simdgroup_matrix` (EXP-0022)
Apple9 has a **dedicated matrix/MAC-array unit**, not a lane-cooperative FMA emulation:
`simdgroup_multiply_accumulate` compiles to a **single novel opcode `0xcf`** (12 B) that performs a full
**8×8×8 tile MAC** (512 scalar MACs). Proven dedicated: a hand-written FMA matmul and a
`simd_shuffle`+`fma` cooperative matmul both contain **zero** `0xcf`.
- **`matrix_mac` (`0xcf`, 12 B):** `d = a·b (+c)`, row-major 8×8. RT-5/RT-10 splice-proved the full operand map on
  the **fp32 datapath**: **byte+5 = A, byte+6 = B, byte+7 = C, byte+8 = dst, byte+11 bit0 = accumulate-enable**
  (swap +5/+6 → B·A; +5→B → B·B; byte+11 `01→00` drops `+c`; op-enable byte+10=`0x24`). ⚠ **The `0x24`/`0x01`
  op-enable/accum byte *values* are fp32-specific:** the **half datapath** (byte+1=`0x00`) encodes them as
  byte+10=`0x8c` / byte+11=`0x00` — the half-datapath accumulate byte is **uncharacterized** (RT-10). Inferred:
  byte+1 = dtype (`0x00` half / `0x02` float-bf16), byte+2 = mode (`0x56` standalone / `0x54` tiled).
- **Dims:** MSL exposes only **8×8** (16×16/8×16/4×4/32×32 rejected). **Types:** fp16, fp32, bfloat, and
  mixed fp16/bf16 → fp32 accumulate; **all integer types rejected** (no int8 coopmat via Metal → Vulkan
  int8 cooperative-matrix must emulate).
- **Fragment load/store** = ordinary `0x67`/`0xe7` memory ops (64-bit load = 2 fp32/lane; 32 lanes × 2 =
  the 64-element 8×8 tile); `make_filled` = a `0x2c`/`0x3c` constant splat. Only the MAC is dedicated silicon.
- **Tensor ops** (`mpp::tensor_ops::matmul2d`, 32×32×32) compile on-device and lower to **259× the same
  `0xcf`** — larger shapes are software-tiled over the 8×8×8 primitive.
- HW-validated: A·B+C with distinct known A,B,C returns correct C.

#### ✅ The matrix unit also computes `A·B − C` — a mode Metal never emits (EXP-0147) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (dense full-range sweeps, 2 gated runs, 100 % cross-run
agreement, zero unstable cases), `target: G16G` (local Apple M4). Source:
`experiments/EXP-0147-m4-emit-pipeline-misc/RESULTS.md` §2.1. **`matrix_mac` is now EMITTABLE**
— both remaining blocking fields resolved, so all 12 of its fields are `hardware-run` or
`isolated-byte-diff`.

**`b11hi` (byte+11 bits 1..7, 7 bits, all 128 values, twice) — the two low bits are accumulator
sign controls, not padding.** Correct `a·b + c` requires **`(b11hi & 3) == 0`** (32 of 128
values); bits 2..6 are don't-care. The other three settings are real, resolved per tile row:

| `b11hi & 3` | rows 0–3 | rows 4–7 | operation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | `+C` | `+C` | `A·B + C` (the only mode `simdgroup_multiply_accumulate` emits) |
| `1` (bit 0) | `−C` | `+C` | **half-tile multiply-subtract** |
| `2` (bit 1) | `−C` | `−C` | **`A·B − C`** (full-tile multiply-subtract) |
| `3` (both) | `+C` | `−C` | **half-tile multiply-subtract, opposite half** |

So the matrix unit performs **matrix multiply-subtract and a half-tile variant**, neither of
which Metal's `simdgroup_multiply_accumulate` ever emits. Found by perturbing a field the
database modelled as opaque `raw` — the extrapolate-and-test method — with the negative-space
value map recorded alongside.

**`dst_desc` (byte+9, all 256 values, twice):** correct `A·B + C` **iff bit 6 = 1 and bit 7 = 0**
(64/64); bits 0–5 are don't-care. `0x00–0x3F` and `0x80–0xBF` (128 values) **silently zero**;
`0xC0–0xFF` (64 values) return a wrong value. Verified as a set identity against the raw
records, not by eyeballing ranges.

> Compare the M5/G17g result `H-M5-1` in [`../hypotheses.md`](../hypotheses.md), where a
> *different* bit (byte+13 bit 6) negates the **A·B product** on Apple10. The two are separate
> findings on separate targets; neither transfers to the other.

### ✅ Hardware ray tracing — HYBRID (EXP-0023)
Apple9 has **dedicated ray-tracing instructions** that drive a **compiler-generated (software) BVH-
traversal loop** in the shader — not one fire-and-forget "trace ray" op. Proven dedicated: both novel
opcodes are absent from a hand-written Möller-Trumbore ray/triangle control.
- **`rt_intersect`** (byte0 low-nibble `0x4`, byte+1 `0xea`, 8 B): the hardware ray/box/triangle
  intersection primitive. **The OP itself is HW-validated dedicated & load-bearing** (RT-5: corrupting
  byte+1 `0xea→0x00` on the traverse op → GPU hang; on the result-read op → distance 3→2.984). Emitted twice
  (traverse, then result-read). ⏳ **Its operand SUB-FIELDS are INFERRED (byte-diff), NOT HW-validated** —
  RT-5 found every documented sub-field was **splice-INERT** on the single-primitive `intersection_query`
  path (identical correct hit for all splices): byte0 hi = result reg (`0xe4→0x04/0x14` no change); byte+2
  mode (`0x90` const-origin / `0x10` dynamic-origin / `0xd0` + function-table — `0x90→0x10/0xd0` no change);
  byte+3/+4 = ray/AS operand regs. **byte+4 is a real AS-type byte-diff correlate — `0x8b` = primitive AS,
  `0x6b` = instance AS** (RT-10 built BOTH AS types and corrects the retracted `0x1b` to the actual **`0x6b`**),
  **but splicing byte+4 is INERT** (`0x8b↔0x6b↔0x1b↔0x00` all give the identical correct hit; only `0xff` faults),
  so it is a passenger/correlate, not the load-bearing selector. The genuine primitive-vs-instance distinction is
  **structural**: the instance kernel emits an extra `rt_intersect` at +0x690 (byte+2=`0x10` dynamic-origin) + ~2×
  the `0xdf` ray-transform loads, and **cross-binding a kernel to the wrong AS type → a clean MISS** (RT-10). byte+2
  mode (`0x90` const-origin / `0x10` dynamic-origin / `0xd0` + function-table) and byte0-hi result reg are likewise
  inert to splice; byte+6 bit7 = intersection-function-table bound. The earlier "EXP-O2C: `0x8b→0x1b` HW-validated
  end-to-end" note is **retracted** (RT-5/RT-10) — `rt_intersect` field *values* are ⏳ byte-diff correlations, and
  the AS-type dispatch is structural (kernel shape), not a spliceable field.
- **`rt_as_load`** (byte0 `0xdf`, 14 B): dedicated acceleration-structure / ray-data node loads
  (14–37 per RT kernel). The traversal is a shader loop (a `−88`-byte back-edge whose body holds a `0xdf`
  node-load + `0x0a` loop-condition compare).
- **Acceleration structure** is referenced by an **8-byte GPU VA in the Tier-2 argument buffer**. ⚠ The
  **BVH *build* is GPU/firmware-managed** — userspace supplies vertices + a build descriptor; the GPU
  writes the BVH; the **BVH node format is NOT userspace-visible** (kernel-interface item, like the
  ZLS / depth-store control). *(Note: sample positions are **not** a kernel item — RT-4 showed they are
  userspace-emittable to a client BO @+0x40; see `kernel-interface.md` §4.2.)*
- **Intersection functions** compile as separate callable functions bound via an
  **`intersection_function_table`** (same model as `visible_function_table`); `ray_data` payload is a
  distinct address space.
- HW-validated: 6 known rays vs a built `MTLAccelerationStructure` (triangle at z=3) → correct t / prim /
  barycentrics; above-apex ray correctly misses. ⏳ Follow-ups: full operand bit-decode; the WWDC
  "reorder" stage; RT-from-render + motion blur.

### ✅ Async completion = hardware register interlock, NOT a software scoreboard (EXP-0025) — CRITICAL compiler guidance
**G17P has no explicit per-op scoreboard `wait` instruction.** Long-latency ops (device load/store,
atomics, texture sample/read) feed their consumers directly; completion is enforced by a **hardware
register interlock** — a consumer that reads a still-pending destination register **stalls in hardware**
until the op retires. This is a **fundamental departure from G13** (which used an explicit 2-byte `wait`
op + a 2-slot software scoreboard, `AGX_MAX_PENDING=8`).
- **Compiler implication:** do **NOT** emit G13-style scoreboard waits / slot assignments — they do not
  exist on G17P, and there is no `AGX_MAX_PENDING` analog (20 independent loads stayed in flight and summed
  correctly; max-in-flight is a HW resource bounded by the register file). The RAW hazard is handled by
  hardware. This makes the backend simpler than G13's.
- **The one remaining silent-corruption surface — the barrier:** cross-lane / threadgroup-memory ordering
  still needs an explicit **barrier**: `threadgroup_barrier` = byte0 `0x07`, 6 B: `07 04 54 <mem_scope>
  <flags> 00`, **byte+3 = fenced memory scope** (`0x61` threadgroup / `0x85` device). `simdgroup_barrier`
  emits no op (lockstep SIMD). Splice-proven: on a 256-thread divergent-writer kernel, corrupting byte+3
  `0x61→0x00` makes **128/256 lanes read stale zeros** (STATUS OK, no fault) — the exact G-1 hazard, and
  the thing a driver author must get right.
- ⏳ This run was compute-only; the fragment/tilebuffer ordering analogue (`wait_pix`/`signal_pix`-style,
  for imageblock/tilebuffer access) is a follow-up.

### ✅ Transcendentals / special functions (EXP-0026, closes G-2)
Two mechanisms; a compiler picks by fast-math vs precise:
- **Special-function unit (SFU)** — the `fspecial` group (byte0 `0x2f`/`0xaf`, 10 B) computes each as a
  **single op**. Function = (byte0 bit7, byte+1): `0xaf`+`00/01/02` = **rcp / rsqrt / exp2**;
  `0x2f`+`00/01/02` = **round / sqrt / log2**. Byte+6 bit 4 is source release, not part of the
  reciprocal opcode. Accuracy: the T8132 reciprocal has `max |D*r-1| = 7.14e-8` over every
  `D=1..1024` (~23.74 effective bits); rsqrt/sqrt/exp2/log2 remain about 0--1 ULP in their tested sets.
- **Estimate + Newton-Raphson (precise mode)** — `fspecial_est` (byte0 `0x29`, 6 B: `29 81 25 <fn> 00 c2`;
  byte+2=`0x25` discriminator; **byte+3 = function**: `0x09` rcp / `0x0b` rsqrt / `0x0d` sqrt). The
  estimate is a classic **~8-bit seed** (measured rcp ~8.0, rsqrt ~7.9, sqrt ~7.5 good mantissa bits);
  the compiler refines with **2 NR iterations** (fma/fmul) → 0 ULP. `precise::sqrt` forces this path.
- **Composites:** `exp = exp2(x·k)`, `log = log2(x)·k`, **`pow(a,b) = exp2(b·log2(a))`**, **`a/b = a·rcp(b)`**.
- **sin/cos/tan** = range-reduction (a `0x2b` reduce op + quadrant select) + polynomial (fma chains);
  `tan = sin·rcp(cos)`. Fast and precise are byte-identical. ⚠ **Driver-facing gap:** ~1 ULP for moderate
  args but **~5·10⁵ ULP at large args** (limited built-in range reduction) — a conformant Vulkan/GL
  `sin/cos` must add **software Payne-Hanek range reduction**.
- *(Clean-room: encodings, semantics, precision, and the textbook NR structure are documented; Apple's
  exact scheduled instruction list is not transcribed — rule 5.)*

### ✅ Mesh / object shaders — HW pipeline, compute-style emit (EXP-0030)
Apple9 mesh shading is a **genuine hardware graphics pipeline**, but — unlike matrix (`0xcf`) and RT
(`0xea`) — **the vertex/primitive emit is NOT a dedicated opcode**. It lowers to ordinary stores:
- `set_vertex` / `set_index` / `set_primitive` = runs of **`0xe7` device stores** into a HW-managed
  mesh-output ("UVB") buffer (proven by opcode-diff vs a hand-written compute control that stores the
  same primitives — identical store family; the mesh `_agc.main` shrinks 306→98 B when it emits nothing).
- `set_primitive_count` = a predicated `lane==0` store of the count. Object payload = ordinary stores.
- Mesh has **no truly mesh-unique opcode** (corrected by EXP-0035): the `0x43` marker seen here is actually
  the **generic call/frame-setup marker** — mesh shows it only because mesh stages call helper subroutines
  (`_agc.object.write_childcount`, `_agc.mesh.write_uvb`). object→mesh **grid amplification** is real
  fixed-function dispatch computed in object `main`.
- Stages extract as `__TEXT,__object` / `__TEXT,__mesh` sections (like vertex/fragment).
- **Implication for Mesa:** compile object/mesh as compute-like store kernels + a child-count write; no

### ✅ Fragment-shader ISA (EXP-0029, closes G-4 + backlog #2/#5/#7)
- **Varying interpolation — `iter`** (byte0 `0x2f`/`0xaf`, byte+2=`0x54`, 10 B; `2f BB 54 DD 03 SS MM 02 NN 00`),
  one op per component. **byte+5 = varying-slot / per-triangle coefficient index (`slot<<1`)** (splice-proven:
  `0x00→0x02` switched output from `color.x` to `color.y`). **byte+6 = mode:** `0x00` center/linear,
  `0x02` centroid/sample, `0x04` perspective-denominator.
  - **`[[flat]]`** = a different, shorter op **`iter_flat`** (byte0 `0x1f`, 6 B) — provoking-vertex load, no interp.
  - **Perspective-correct is a multi-instruction lowering** (not a mode bit): linear `iter`s + a W-denominator
    `iter` + `0xaf` reciprocal + per-component `fmul`.
  - **centroid/sample** add an 8-B `iter_at` setup (byte+6=`0x0a`; byte+7 `0x01` centroid / `0x03` sample).
    Pull-model `interpolate_at_*` == the matching `[[*_perspective]]` qualifier.
- **Fragment output — `frag_color_store`** (byte0 `0xe7`, byte+1=`0x06`, 12 B): **byte+3 = source colour reg,
  byte+5 = render-target index (`rt<<1`)** (splice-proven). MRT = one store per target. `discard_fragment()`
  HW-proven (killed fragments write nothing). `[[depth]]` out = `0xd7 14 54` (6 B). Dual-source = extra output
  reg, no distinct op.
- **Tilebuffer read — `tile_read`** (byte0 `0x67`, byte+1=`0x0e`, 12 B): a `[[color(n)]]` *input* reads the
  tilebuffer (the `ld_tile` analogue). HW-proven: `out = src*0.5 + clear*0.5` — confirms in-shader
  programmable blend (EXP-0019). **Now EMITTABLE with a per-field legal-value set — and its
  failure mode is a silent zero (a black tile), not a fault: see the `tile_read` section below
  (EXP-0147, `target: G16G`).**
- **Pixel ordering (raster-order-groups) — `pixel_order`** (byte0 `0x07` fence family, same as the compute
  `threadgroup_barrier`): `07 14 54 50 06 00` (acquire) + `07 04 54 d0 06 00` (release).
  ~~⏳ byte-diff inferred.~~ **SUPERSEDED — now HW-VALIDATED with the full accepted value set per
  field, and `pixel_order` is EMITTABLE: see the `pixel_order` section below (EXP-0147,
  `target: G16G`).**

### ⚠️ Barycentric interpolation is BROKEN when the fragment shader reads `[[position]]` (EXP-0137) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (own-MSL compile + disassembly + hardware readback, two gated
runs), `target: G16G` (local Apple M4). Source:
`experiments/EXP-0137-m4-bary-split-abi/RESULTS.md`. This is the single most surprising
fragment-stage fact in the P0.8 work and a driver must know it before it lowers
`gl_BaryCoord` / `SPV_KHR_fragment_shader_barycentric`.

**The trigger is the fragment shader reading `[[position]]`.** Not output count, not an extra
varying, not the harness — each of those was controlled for.

| variant class | measured `barycentric_coord` at the sample point |
|---|---|
| non-position (`base`, `count3_const`, `count3_vary`, `attach3ctrl`) | `(0.243489, 0.134766, 0.621745)` — **correct** |
| position-touching (`pos3`, `pos2`, `posread_noout`) | `(0.486979, 0.269532, 0.243489)` — **broken** |

`posread_noout` only **stores** position to a `device` buffer and never emits it, and it is still
broken. The ratio between the two is **exactly 2.0**: the broken values are **unnormalized
perspective numerators**, with the third component derived as `1 − b0 − b1` and the
normalize-by-sum step simply **absent**.

**What the disassembly of our own compiled shaders shows:** the broken form has **2 `iter` ops
and ZERO `fspecial`**. The discriminating control is `count3_vary` — `iter = 6`, `fspecial = 1`,
i.e. a reciprocal **is** present and the result is still correct — so *"an rcp exists"* is not
the condition. The condition is the `[[position]]` read.

**⛔ NEGATIVE, and it removes the obvious workaround: MSL's
`[[barycentric_coord, center_perspective]]` / `[[..., center_no_perspective]]` qualifier
compiles but is a COMPLETE NO-OP.** Both qualified forms produce **identical disassembly** to
the unqualified form (`iter = 2`, `fspecial = 0`) and identical results. **There is no
MSL-level escape hatch.** A driver that needs correct perspective barycentrics in a shader that
also reads `[[position]]` must normalize the numerators itself.

**Convention (needed to match Vulkan/GL semantics):** `barycentric_coord.x/y/z` follow **vertex
emission order** (`vid % 3 = 0, 1, 2`); perspective-correct is the intended semantic.

**Related P0.8 result — there is no native prolog/epilog split contract, and inlining is not
`noinline`-controllable.** Refining EXP-0109: a **memory-touching vertex helper** and a
**2-call-site compute helper** *are* kept out-of-line, as named Mach-O local symbols reached by
a real `call` / `frame_marker` / `pop_reconverge` sequence — but a **single-call-site fragment
epilog inlines despite `noinline`**. An implementer cannot rely on the compiler's out-of-lining
to define a stage ABI boundary.

### ✅ `tile_read` / `tile_read_mrt` are EMITTABLE — and their failure mode is a black tile (EXP-0147) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (all 256 values per byte, twice; liveness proven by a
clear-colour control and a litmus-power probe that collapses the read to zero), `target: G16G`.
Source: `experiments/EXP-0147-m4-emit-pipeline-misc/RESULTS.md` §2.2. All 7 `tile_read` fields
and all 6 `tile_read_mrt` fields promoted. This advances **P0.4**: a BG/EOT program's tilebuffer
read is now a specified encoding with a stated legal-value set per field, not a copied template.

| field | rule, measured over all 256 values, twice |
|---|---|
| `b2` | **fully inert** — all 256 values give the byte-exact correct pixel |
| `b4` | **fully inert** — all 256 correct |
| **`b6`** | **bit 0 is a READ-ENABLE.** All 128 **odd** values are correct; all 128 **even** values return a **SILENT ZERO**. Bits 1–7 don't-care. Identical on `tile_read_mrt`. |
| `rt_index` | correct only at `0x00, 0x01, 0x80, 0x81` (baseline `0x00`) — bit 0 and bit 7 don't-care; **every other index silently returns zero** with one attachment bound |
| `dst` | correct only at `0x00, 0x01, 0xC0, 0xC1`; `0x02–0x07` wrong; the bulk silently zero; `0xF6–0xFF` fault or collateral |
| `b7` | correct only at `0xAE, 0xAF, 0xEE, 0xEF` (baseline `0xAE`); **85 of 256 values are nondeterministic** across replicates |
| `tail` | bytes 1 and 3 almost entirely **silent zero** off their baseline; byte 0 is nondeterminism-heavy |

`tile_read_mrt` reproduces the same shape shifted by its baseline (`dst` OK at
`0x08, 0x09, 0xC8, 0xC9`; `rt_index` OK at `0x08, 0x09, 0x88, 0x89`) and additionally resolves
**`fmt`**: correct only at `0x2E, 0x2F, 0x6E, 0x6F, 0xAE, 0xAF, 0xEE, 0xEF` — **bits 0, 6 and 7
are don't-care and bits 1–5 are the format selector**.

> **The single most useful driver fact here:** an emitter that gets `rt_index`, `dst`, `b6` or
> `fmt` wrong **does not get a fault — it gets a silent zero**, which in a BG/EOT program means
> a tile that reads as **black** rather than a program that fails loudly. Self-enforce these
> value sets; the hardware will not.

### ✅ `pixel_order` (raster-order groups) — the full accepted value sets, and a `db.json` defect (EXP-0147) — `target: G16G`

The ⏳ "byte-diff inferred" status above is superseded for this pair. Detection strength first:
with the **acquire** member's byte+4 corrupted, the read-back texel falls from `8·src` to
`1·src` — **7 of 8 serialised read-modify-writes are lost** — and the accumulated pixel falls
from `clear + 36·src` to `clear + 8·src`, byte-identical in both gated runs. So an "inert"
verdict from this litmus is a measurement, not a blind spot. **The acquire/release asymmetry is
itself a result:** the same corruption on the **release** member loses **no** updates at all.

| field | acquire member (`07 14 54 50 06 00`) | release member (`07 04 54 d0 06 00`) |
|---|---|---|
| `scope` (byte+3) | correct iff **bit4 = 1 and bit6 XOR bit7 = 1** (64/256) | correct iff **bit4 = 1 and bit7 = 1** (64/256) |
| `flags` (byte+4) | correct iff **bit0 = 0 and `(v & 0x0E) != 0`** (112/256) | correct iff **`(v & 0x0F) >= 2`** (224/256) |
| `b5` (byte+5) | **fully inert**, all 256 | **fully inert**, all 256 |

> **`db.json` defect (recorded, not patched here):** `pixel_order` declares a field `flags` at
> bits[32:40] **and** a match constant `[32,8,6]` pinning the same bits to `0x06`. The hardware
> accepts 112 (acquire) / 224 (release) distinct values there with the program still byte-exactly
> correct, so byte+4 is a **genuine field, not a constant** — and as modelled, every legal
> encoding with byte+4 ≠ `0x06` is neither decodable nor emittable.

### ✅ `vtx_out_pos`, `vtx_coord_xform`, `n3_sample_read` (EXP-0147) — `target: G16G`

- **`vtx_out_pos`:** `dst` (16 values) and `slot` (256 values) are **fully inert** in this
  carrier — every value leaves the interpolated pixel byte-exact — and the arm's litmus-power
  probe (corrupting the op-select constant) *does* move the pixel, so this is measured inertness,
  not a blind spot. **Scope limit:** the carrier has a **single output slot**, so this says
  nothing about `slot` in a program with several varyings.
- **`vtx_coord_xform.mode`:** correct exactly when `(mode & 0xF3) ∈ {0x22, 0xE2}` (8/256);
  **240 of 256 values suppress the draw entirely**, 8 give a wrong pixel. `sel`: 91 correct,
  143 no-draw, **19 genuine `Caused GPU Hang Error` faults**. `operand`: bytes 0 and 4 fully
  inert (256/256 each), **byte 3 is fault-prone**.
- **`n3_sample_read`:** `b1` and `b3` fully inert (256/256 each); 5 of the 6 `tail` bytes fully
  inert; only `tail` byte 0 matters, where **53 values fault**.

### ⛔ Fences: a bounded negative with the litmus power to mean something (EXP-0147) — `target: G16G`

`scoreboard_fence` (`07 42 02 00`, in a device-atomic carrier): **all 256 `kind`, all 128
`scope`, all 256 `mask` values leave the result bit-exact — and so does corrupting byte 0, the
opcode itself.** `compute_fence_scoped` (`87 00 80 04`; threadgroup store → barrier → +137
far-neighbour load, so every lane reads a slot written by a different simdgroup): `kind` and
`scope` fully inert; **`mask` breaks the result at exactly 10 of 256 values**
(`0x00, 0x08, 0x0C, 0x10, 0x18, 0x80, 0x88, 0x8C, 0x90, 0x98`), reproducibly.

The carriers are not powerless — neutering the neighbouring `threadgroup_barrier` breaks each
program outright — but that demonstrates *general* detection sensitivity, **not
ordering-specific** sensitivity, and the pre-registered sensitivity control (corrupt the fence's
own byte 0) **passed when it was registered to fail**. Under the frozen rule all six fence
fields are therefore reported **`untested`**, with the live `compute_fence_scoped.mask` signal
recorded as the highest-value follow-up.

### ✅ Special-register enum + shader ABI (EXP-0031, closes G-5)
**`get_sr` SR number = byte1** (splice-proven: splicing byte1 makes the output become that SR's value):

| SR | code (byte1) | SR | code |
|---|---|---|---|
| thread_position_in_grid .x/.y/.z | `0xa0/a1/a2` | threadgroup_position_in_grid | `0x9c/9d/9e` |
| thread_position_in_threadgroup | `0xa4/a5/a6` | threads_per_threadgroup | `0x98/99/9a` |
| thread_index_in_threadgroup | `0xa7` | threadgroups_per_grid | `0xa8/a9/aa` |
| simd_lane_id | `0x82` | simd_group_id | `0x85` |
| vertex_id | `0xdd` | instance_id | `0xd8` |
| base_vertex / base_instance | `0x88` / `0x8a` (**HW-VALIDATED**, EXP-0092: 9 indexed+instanced draws incl. negative/boundary params; `base_vertex==baseVertex`, `base_instance==baseInstance` exactly, both runs byte-identical) | `[[position]]`.xy (FS) | `0xa0/0xa1` |
| front_facing (FS) | `0xc5` | | |

- **Folded/computed (not `get_sr`):** `threads_per_simdgroup` → `mov_imm 0x20` (=32); simdgroups_per_tg,
  quad indices are ALU-computed; FS `barycentric_coord`/`point_coord` are **interpolated** (`0x2f` family);
  `primitive_id` = flat tiler-output load; `sample_id` folds to 0 on a 1-sample target.
- **⚠ `threadgroups_per_grid` (`0xa8/a9/aa`) is NOT a direct SR value (RT-7):** a bare `get_sr 0xa8`
  spliced alone returns **threads_per_threadgroup** (it tracks `tg` exactly), not the grid's threadgroup
  count. The `threadgroups_per_grid` *builtin* is `get_sr 0xa8` **+ a `device_load` + a divide** (visible as
  `24 a8 10 06 … 67 10 44` in the compiler output); the builtin computes correctly (grid/tg → 256/64=4,
  192/64=3). So `0xa8` is the code the compiler uses for this builtin, but a driver emitting a bare
  `get_sr 0xa8` and expecting the threadgroup count would get threads_per_threadgroup instead. (Every other
  code in the table above IS the direct SR value, splice-proven; only `0xa8` carries this build-and-divide
  nuance — no code is mislabeled.)
- **Preloaded-register ABI:** **no stage preloads IDs into GPRs** — IDs are read via `get_sr` on demand.
  Only **buffer/vertex base pointers + scalar uniforms** are preloaded into the **uniform register file**
  (selected by `device_load` byte+4 `base_slot`; the **vertex-buffer base = slot `0x03`**).
- **Vertex attribute fetch is IN-SHADER SOFTWARE (no fixed-function fetch).** Metal lowers the
  `MTLVertexDescriptor` into the VS prologue: **per attribute** a `device_load` (`0x67`) from the vertex
  base (uniform slot 3) at **`index×stride + offset`** + a format-convert ALU; `index` = `get_sr` `vertex_id`
  (`0xdd`) or `instance_id` (`0xd8`) per step-rate. **stride/offset/format live in the compiled shader**
  (shader-specialized); the attribute table `0x10000100000` (EXP-0014) supplies only the base pointer. ⟶ A
  Mesa driver must **generate attribute-fetch code from the vertex format** (like Asahi does).
- **FS input/epilog:** varyings via the `0x2f/0xaf` interpolation datapath reading plane-equation
  coefficients loaded by `0x97` from tiler output; color return via the shared epilog (see `frag_color_store`).

### ✅ Integer / bitfield completeness (EXP-0033, closes backlog #12)
- **Bit-count / scan** — single-op family (byte0 `0x27`/`0xa7`, byte+2 `0x56`, 8 B; op-select = byte0 bit7 +
  byte+1): `popcount` = `27 05 56`, `reverse_bits` = `a7 04 56`, **find-MSB / bit-scan-reverse** = `a7 05 56`
  (a primitive Metal doesn't name; `0x80000000`→31). `clz`/`ctz` are **multi-instruction lowerings** (find-MSB
  + sub + clamp; `ctz` adds a `0x2b` low-bit-isolate).
- **Bitfield:** unsigned `extract_bits` = single `0xa7` 12 B ibfe; **signed extract = ibfe + sign-ext shift**
  (signedness is a lowering). **`insert_bits` has no dedicated op** (mask `0x0b` + shift `0x2b` + combine `0x9f`).
- **Rotate:** by **immediate** = a single 12 B `0x27` funnel op (byte+1=`0x01`); by **register** = multi-instr.
- **min3/max3/median3:** MSL exposes them but there is **no dedicated silicon** — lowered to 2-input int
  min/max (`0x02` group). `clamp` = max-then-min.
- **Pack/unpack + 16-bit:** `as_type` bitcast is **free**. Native fp16 = the **`0x10`** group (`0x1c` hadd /
  `0x1d` hmul); **`half2` packs both lanes into one `0x10` op**, but **`int16` does NOT pack** (two 32-bit
  `0x9f` adds). `pack_unorm2x16` = single `0x97`, unpack = single `0x17` (byte+2-gated vs frag-pack/ballot).
- **64-bit integer:** register pairs, but **native single-op 64-bit add/sub exists** (splice-proven: `u64_sub`
  is one `0x1f`; `0x1f→0x9f` gives a 64-bit add with **hardware carry-out**). **Re-validated
  against an independently recomputed oracle on M4/G16G — exact bytes, boundary rows and the
  stated limitation are in the EXP-0146 section below.** Compiler may also emit an explicit
  carry chain (`0x32` carry-generate). 32×32→64 mul = one 12 B `0x9f`; 64×64 = 3 mul(-add)s; register shift/
  compare = multi-instr.
- *(EXP-0033 also corrected DB length-rule bugs for the `0xa7 b1∈{04,05}` 8B, `0x27 b1=01` 12B rotate, and the
  `0x10` half group — defined in `experiments/EXP-0033-int-bitfield/new_descriptors.json`, now merged into db.json.)*

### ✅ Integer-ALU emitter-grade rules (EXP-0139) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (dense splice sweeps plus host oracles), `target: G16G`
(local Apple M4). Source: `experiments/EXP-0139-m4-emit-ialu/RESULTS.md`. **39 fields reached
`hardware-run` and 34 `isolated-byte-diff`** of 137 blocking; **`ibitcount` (8/8) and `iunary`
(3/3) became EMITTABLE.**

**`ibfe`'s `offset` and `width` use OPPOSITE out-of-range rules.** This is the highest-value
single fact in the section for a NIR back-end:

| field | rule | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `offset` | **LITERAL.** 0..31 shift normally; **32..63 shift the field out**. The literal model scores **64/64**; a mod-32 model scores 32/64. **The hardware does NOT implement NIR's `offset`-mod-32 masking** — a back-end that assumes it must mask in software. | dense sweep, 2 gated runs |
| `width` | **mod-32.** The mod-32 model scores **64/64**; a literal-clamp model scores 37/64. Therefore **`width = 32` ≡ `width = 0`**. | dense sweep, 2 gated runs |

The `width` result **refutes EXP-0139's own pre-registration**, scored competitively on the same
data — recorded here rather than quietly dropped.

Other results from the same sweep, all `target: G16G`:

- **`ibitcount.tail`:** dense 0..255 on a **fully synthesized** popcount shows **only bit 2 is
  load-bearing**.
- **`iunary.operand` was never one field** — it is **five one-byte sub-fields** carrying
  `ibitcount`'s meanings (defect `DEF-0139-1`, applied to `db.json`).
- **⚠️ EXP-0112's `r(R mod 64)` register aliasing does NOT transfer to `iadd2.dst`.** At
  `dst = 140/141` (register 70) the sum **never appeared in r6**. The fault boundary is
  `reg ≥ 96`, at 60 dense values, 5/5. **Do not carry an operand model across instruction
  families** — the same caution EXP-0138 records for `falu_srcmod12b` vs `falu2`.
- **`isel_reg8` has no corpus anchor, but constructing it works**: `isel8` byte+2
  `0x0f` → `0x25` executes on hardware. (Synthesis, not tokenization.)
- **`iminmax`: EXP-0113's reported nondeterminism did NOT reproduce** — 858 cases, 4× each, all
  agreed. `fmax`/`fmin` diverge from IEEE **only on NaN and denormals** (flush-to-zero plus NaN
  suppression).

> **Concurrency caution — this changes how you must read any sweep on this hardware.** Across
> **129,839 dispatches**, **44 % of gated-run faults did not reproduce** and 1,552 attempts
> carried `…ErrorInnocentVictim`. Without `experiments/FIELD-SWEEP-PROTOCOL.md` §7,
> **692 legal field values would have been labelled `fault`.** Only **3 of 29,685** cases are
> genuinely nondeterministic. A "fault" verdict from a single observation on a contended host is
> not evidence.

### ✅ Native single-instruction 64-bit integer ADD, re-validated with an oracle (EXP-0146) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (splice + independently recomputed oracle, two gated runs),
`target: G16G` (local Apple M4). Source: `experiments/EXP-0146-m4-emit-int-misc/RESULTS.md`.
This confirms and sharpens the "native single-op 64-bit add/sub exists" bullet above, which came
from EXP-0033 on A18/G17P.

`out[gid] = a - b` on `ulong` compiles to **six instructions with exactly ONE arithmetic op** —
an `iadd2`, bytes `1f 01 56 00 02 08 00 50 17 05`, with loads/store using element code 4
(8 bytes). **Flipping only byte0 bit 7 (`0x1f` → `0x9f`, the add/sub selector HW-validated in
RT-1a-FIX) yields an exact 64-bit ADD with carry across the 32-bit word boundary.** Because the
kernel holds one arithmetic instruction, **the carry is produced inside it.**

Verified against an independently recomputed oracle on all 8 boundary rows of a second input
set — `0x8000…0 + 0x8000…0 = 0`; `0x7FFF…F + 1 = 0x8000…0`;
`0xFFFFFFFF00000000 + 0x00000000FFFFFFFF = 0xFFFF…F`; `0xFFFF…E + 3 = 1` — 5/5 serial
repetitions, zero fault classes, both gated runs.

**Apple's compiler emits a 5-instruction chain instead**, so this is a capability Metal never
reaches. **LIMITATION, stated:** it was validated by flipping one bit in the compiler's *own*
64-bit subtract, **not synthesized from scratch**; the operand-widening byte was **located**
(byte+7 `0x50` vs `0xA8`) but **not isolated**.

Also established in the same experiment, `target: G16G`:

- **`ilogic` reaches ALL 16 boolean functions** via a collision-free
  `(op_base, lut_a & 3, lut_b & 0x0F)` selector. This **refines EXP-0102's "10 of 16"**, which
  described what MSL *source* can express, not what the encoding can reach.
- **`carry_gen` is a two-operand compare**: `p[dst] = r[byte+1] <u r[byte+3]`.
- **`iadd2` `dst ≥ 96` faults** (consistent with the 96-GPR hard boundary above).
- ⛔ **NEGATIVE, honestly scoped:** `int_alu_ehi` **0/7** — a second, independently authored
  std140 matrix copy again emitted `imad`, reproducing EXP-M4-13. `sr_read_wide` **0/6** — the
  ray-query kernel emits it, but the testbed cannot bind an `MTLAccelerationStructure`, so it
  runs returning zeros and the field is not live. **That is a testbed gap, not a hardware fact.**

### ✅ Texture variants (EXP-0034, closes backlog #14)
The 14-byte sample bundle generalizes to every variant via **op+2** (variant/dim/LOD/compare/offset),
**op+6** (mode), **companion+3** (result descriptor), and register operands from preceding ALU:
- **sample_compare (shadow/PCF):** **op+2 bit5 (`0x20`) = depth-compare** (`sample_compare(level)`=`0x29`),
  scalar result (companion+3=`0xa0`); the **compare-reference is a register operand**; the sampler
  descriptor's `compareFunction` (EXP-0015 sense bit39 + test[40:42]) evaluates `ref CMP sampledDepth`. All 8
  compare funcs HW-validated; **linear filter yields fractional PCF** ⇒ **native 2×2 hardware PCF**.
- **gather:** op+6 `0x00` + result-desc in companion+3 (`0xa4/ac/b4/bc`: bit2=gather, bits[3:5]=component
  R/G/B/A, HW-validated). **gather_compare** = gather + op+2 `0x20`. **Constant offset packs into op+5**
  (`(1,0)→0x08`, `(1,1)→0x88`, HW-validated).
- **sample_lod/bias/grad:** op+2 `0x09`/`0x07`/`0x04`; value in a preceding-ALU register; **op+7 bit2** =
  explicit-LOD/bias present.
- **LOD query** (`calculate_*_lod`) = a real texture op (op+6 `0x20`; clamped/unclamped in companion+3).
- **✅ Texture/image atomics are NATIVE** (supported, not rejected): `atomic_*` on `texture2d<uint,rw>` /
  `texture_buffer` lower to the **memory-family device atomic (`0x67`)** with the texel address computed
  in-shader (texture2d: byte+1 `0x11`, op-byte `|0x40`). HW-proven (256 contended adds → 256).
- **array/cube/3D/MSAA:** `read` dim in op+2 (`0x17` 2D / `0x79` 3D / `0x97` 2D-array bit7 / `0x80` MSAA);
  `sample` encodes cube `0x13` / 3D `0x39` / cube-array `0x53` in op+2; extra index (slice/face/z/sample/ref)
  = an added coord register selected via op+3 (⏳ byte-diff, not splice-validated).

### ✅ Function calls / pointers / dynamic libraries ABI (EXP-0035, closes backlog #13)
CALL/RETURN are in the **control-flow family** (byte0 low-nibble `0xf`), not a dedicated opcode group.
- **CALL** = `0f 05 54 1a 8f 00 56 <off40> 00` (14 B): `off40` = signed LE PC-relative, **target = call_addr
  + 4 + off40** (verified at 4 distances). Reuses the exec-mask push (`0f 05`) machinery (a masked branch
  saving the return context; disambiguated by byte+4=`0x8f`+byte+6=`0x56`). Each call preceded by a
  `43 00 00 01` **call/frame marker** and followed by a `0f 06 …` reconverge.
- **RETURN** = `8f <lm> 54 00` (4 B; `0x8f` = CF-family + link bit): **no encoded target ⇒ return address is
  a hardware link register / CF stack**. `lm` = `0x02` leaf / `0x12` non-leaf.
- **Calling convention:** args in **r10, r11, r12…**, return value in **r10**. Leaf callee = no frame;
  **non-leaf** = `6f…` prologue bracketing each nested call with `07…` link save/restore to **per-thread
  scratch** (the EXP-0020 spill stack). Recursion is lowered to a loop (tail) ⇒ statically bounded depth.
- **Function pointers (`visible_function_table`):** a **flat array of 8-byte little-endian code VAs**
  (`entry[i]` = function i's entry-point GPU VA), bound as a **Tier-2 argument-buffer slot** (same model as
  RT `intersection_function_table`, EXP-0023). Resolve: uniform index → in the constant/uniform program;
  per-lane index → device-load `entry[sel]` → **indirect call `0f 80`**. HW-validated (`sel=0→A+B, 1→A*B`).
- **Dynamic libraries (`MTLDynamicLibrary`):** serialize to a Mach-O **filetype 14 (MH_DYLIB)** with AGX code
  in `__TEXT,__text`; consumer references `<name>.MTL_VISIBLE_FN_REF`, **resolved at pipeline-build** (code
  linked in adjacent, then an ordinary direct call). The "dynamic" part is **loader resolution** — a
  kernel-interface concern (see `../kernel-interface.md`).

### ✅ Wrap-up decode: pack / carry / frame (EXP-0038, closes census compute gaps)
- **Half pack `0x18`** (4 B, `18 05 18 03`): assembles the two fp16 lanes from the native-half `0x10` ALU into a
  packed 32-bit register before store. **byte0 high nibble = dst register** ⇒ same op appears as `0x08/18/28/38`
  (dst r0–r3), which is why the census saw `0x30/0x38` in high-register vertex/frag code. HW-validated (float2→fp16
  round-trip). byte+2 = source reg.
- **u64 carry-generate `0x32`** (6 B, `32 01 35 03 22 81`; in the integer-compare family, byte+2=`0x35`, byte+4=`0x22`):
  the `ulong a+b` chain is `9f` lo-add → **`0x32` carry-gen** → `0x05` psel (carry→0/1) → `9f` hi-add → `9f` +carry.
  HW-validated + splice-proven load-bearing (neutralizing `0x32` drops the carry). Siblings `0x12`/`0x22`.
- **Non-leaf function frame** (EXP-0035 completed): `0x6f` prologue (6 B, `6f 03 04 00 00 20`, in the helper region,
  absent in leaf); each nested call bracketed by an 8-byte `0x07` **link save/restore** (`07 00 54 …`, gated by
  byte+1=`0x00`); return `8f 12 54 00` (leaf `8f 02`). HW-validated (3-level deep).
- **⚠️ `0x54↔0x56` cache bit — STATUS DOWNGRADED TO `UNKNOWN` (EXP-0086, 2026-08-28). DO NOT
  TREAT AS INERT.** The former claim below ("a source cache / last-use hint, NOT an op change")
  rested solely on RT-1a-FIX, which spliced an instruction and re-checked *that same instruction's
  own result* — a test structurally incapable of detecting a register-liveness effect, whose
  failure mode is a **later** instruction's read. EXP-0086 ran the missing later-read test and
  found that **a bit in the same conceptual role, in the same float-ALU family, silently corrupts a
  later separate instruction's read when flipped on the earlier (producer) instruction** —
  deterministically, with no fault: the later read returned the source as **zero**. Polarity:
  natural encoding is earlier-reader bit 0 / later-reader bit 1; forcing the *earlier* reader's bit
  to 1 corrupts. The earlier instruction's bit alone decides the outcome. The **literal** bit 17
  could not be tested directly — in every family it could be compiled into, splicing proved bit 17
  is part of the **opcode** (`opsel`), not a free bit — so `0x54`/`0x56`/`0x18`/`0x38` are
  `UNKNOWN` pending their own later-read test, **not** confirmed inert. **Implementer guidance:
  emit these bits exactly as the pattern you copied them from; do not synthesize or "normalize"
  them, and do not assume a wrong value is harmless.** Historical claim, retained for the record:
  a standalone `simd_reduce` emits `0x56`; the same op as a second consumer of a shared source emits `0x54`. The DB
  gated on `0x56` only (the census gap); fix relaxes the gate to bit-17-don't-care for `0xbf/0x3f/0xb7` reduce +
  `0x17` unpack (keeping the `0x37` derivative-vs-quad-reduce split). *(descriptors staged in
  `experiments/EXP-0038-pack-carry-frame/new_descriptors.json` for merge.)*

### ✅ Pack / unpack / convert — `db.json`'s operand model was wrong; the real one is emittable (EXP-0144) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`** (dense 0..255 per byte, majority-of-3 escalating to 5),
`target: G16G` (local Apple M4). Source: `experiments/EXP-0144-m4-emit-pack/RESULTS.md`.
**`pack_convert` and `unpack_convert` are now EMITTABLE.**

> **⚠️ SELF-WITHDRAWAL, preserved.** An earlier version of EXP-0144's own results claimed
> **44 of 51** blocking fields at emitter grade. **That figure is withdrawn.** It rested on
> captures taken while a GPU test had destabilised WindowServer and taken `MTLCompilerService`
> down machine-wide. Re-measuring every case with a majority vote, and refusing to carry any
> label forward from those runs, gives **33** (31 `hardware-run`, 2 `isolated-byte-diff`);
> 18 fields return to `untested`. The 11-field difference is almost entirely **coverage**, not
> contradiction — two instruments (`cvt_bf16`, `packed_half2_hi`) and most of a third
> (`cvt_f2h_dst`) were never re-measured. Of the measurements that *were* repeated, only
> **92 of 13,783 (0.67 %)** were overturned.

**`pack_convert` — `db.json` models several live operand bytes as one opaque raw descriptor
(`fmt_word`). Measured (6,540 cases, 65/65 baseline checks, 0 indeterminate):**

| byte | `db.json` name | what it actually is | emission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| +1 | `src_desc` | operand descriptor | `v & 0x05 == 0x04`; bits 1,3,4,5,6,7 **don't-care** |
| +2 | `fmt_class` | **1-bit enable** | reproduces the result **iff bit 1 is set**; bits 0, 2–7 inert |
| +3 | `src` | **DESTINATION register** | `reg << 1`, bit 0 don't-care — result redirected into **6 distinct** observed registers |
| +4 | `mode` | 1-bit enable | iff bit 1 set; all other bits inert |
| +5 | *(fmt_word)* | **lane-0 SOURCE register** | `reg << 2`, bits 0–1 don't-care |
| +6 | *(fmt_word)* | **lane-1 SOURCE register** | `reg << 3`, bits 1–2 don't-care, bit 0 must be 0 |
| +7 | *(fmt_word)* | descriptor | `v & 0xFB == 0x50`; bit 2 don't-care |
| +8 | *(fmt_word)* | conversion enable | **bits 2 and 6 both set** (exact over 256) |
| +9 | *(fmt_word)* | **FORMAT SELECTOR** | see table below |

**Format code table (byte+9)** — a code is listed only if ONE host model explains **all 8**
independent semantic vectors, NaN and out-of-range inputs included:

| byte+9 | format produced |
|---|---|
| `0x42 0x46 0x4A 0x4E` | **snorm2x16** (scale 32767) |
| `0x82 0x86 0x8A 0x8E` | **unorm2x16** (scale 65535) |
| `0xC2 0xC6 0xCA 0xCE` | **unorm 8-bit lanes** (scale 255) into bits [7:0] and [15:8], bits 31:16 zero — consistent with the low half of a `unorm4x8` pack, since this carrier supplies only two lanes |

Bits 2 and 3 are don't-care (hence four codes per format); bits 6:7 select the format. **The
8-bit form is a third pack format reachable from the same instruction** that our corpus never
showed, because the compiler emitted only the two 16-bit forms here. Spot-checks: `0x42`,
`(0.25, 0.75)` → `0x5FFF2000` = snorm `(8192, 24575)`, and `−1` clamps to `0x8001 = −32767`
(the symmetric scale of EXP-0079); `0x82`, same input → `0xBFFF4000` = unorm `(16384, 49151)`;
`0xC2`, same input → `0x0000BF40` = `(64, 191)` = `round(0.25·255), round(0.75·255)`.

**`unpack_convert` byte+2 — the exact rule, and it reconciles two earlier results.**

> **`unpack_convert` byte+2 reproduces the conversion iff `(byte & 0x03) != 0`.** Bits 2–7 are
> completely inert. Exact over all 256 values.

EXP-0089 found `0x56 → 0x54` breaks the instruction (`0x54 & 3 == 0`, so it does). EXP-0119's
7-bit re-sweep flipped single bits of `0x56` and found all seven inert (every such flip except
bit 1 leaves `(byte & 3) != 0`, so it is). **Neither observation was wrong — both are the same
two-bit OR-enable seen through a one-bit window.** `db.json`'s relaxed match (bit 1 only) is
still not the hardware rule.

| byte | `db.json` name | what it actually is | emission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| +1 | `src_class` | descriptor | `bits 0,2 == 0,1` (exact over 256) |
| +2 | `cache` | **2-bit OR enable** | `(v & 0x03) != 0`; bits 2–7 inert |
| +3 | *(convert_desc)* | **DESTINATION register** | redirected into 3 distinct observed registers |
| +4 | *(convert_desc)* | **completely INERT** | all 256 values reproduce the result |
| +5 | *(convert_desc)* | **SOURCE register** | `reg << 3`, bits 0–2 don't-care |
| +6 | *(convert_desc)* | opcode/descriptor | `bits 0,2 == 0,1` (exact over 256) |
| +7 | `size` + `reg_sel` | **FORMAT + a source-register bit** | below |

**`reg_sel` is not a register selector.** `db.json` calls byte+7's high nibble "most likely the
unpack RESULT destination (role INFERRED)". Measured: `0x0A 0x8A` → **unorm8** unpack of the low
byte; `0x2A 0xAA` → **snorm16**; `0x4A 0xCA` → **unorm16** (the anchor's format); `0x6A 0xEA` →
**unorm8**. So **bits 6:5 select the format and bit 7 is don't-care**, while **bit 3 changes
which register is read**. This also explains why our own compiler emits `…1cca` for unorm2x16
and `…1caa` for snorm2x16 — a **format** difference `db.json` attributes to a register.

**The `cvt_*` cluster shares one operand layout.** `cvt_i2f` and `cvt_f2i` share the eight-byte
core; **`cvt_f2h` and `cvt_f2h_dst` are the same encoding.** The former `cvt_i2f_src` descriptor
was not a separate opcode: byte+1 `0x17` is ordinary `cvt_i2f` form 7 with pending-mask slot 1 set.

| bytes/bits | `cvt_i2f` | `cvt_f2i` |
|---|---|---|
| bits 12..17 | six-slot pending dependency mask | same |
| +2 high six bits | residual operand mode | same |
| +3 (`dst`) | **`reg << 1`** | same |
| +4 (`src_class`) | source descriptor | same |
| +5 (`src`) | **`reg << 2`** | **`reg << 2`** |
| +6 (`cvtop`) | conversion/width selector | conversion selector |
| +7 (`signflag`) | bit 6 signed/unsigned source | bit 6 signed/unsigned result |
| +8 continuation | — | bit 0 result format; bit 1 RTE(0)/RTZ(1) |
| +9 continuation | — | reserved/inert in the tested envelope |

`cvt_i2f` is eight bytes. `cvt_f2i` is ten bytes: its eight-byte core is followed by a two-byte
result/rounding continuation, hardware-proven by EXP-M4-43. The continuation is not an independent
compact instruction.

Sweeping byte+3 moves the conversion result into **six different output slots** at predictable
field values (`slot6←{0,1}`, `slot5←{6,7}`, `slot4←{10,11}`, `slot3←{14,15}`, `slot2←{18,19}`,
`slot1←{22,23}`, anchor `slot0←{24,25}`), i.e. **`field = register << 1` with bit 0 free**.
`pack_convert` byte+3 produces the **identical** map — which is why it is reclassified above
from `src` to `dst`.

EXP-0238 replaces that small observation window with a generated complete register proof for the
canonical signed FP32-to-I32 form. Its exact emitter recipe is:

```text
27 07 56 (D<<1) 02 (S<<2) b4 48 03 00
```

`D=0..95` and `S=0..63`; the otherwise-free low destination bit and two low source bits are
accepted aliases in this envelope. Conversion truncates toward zero, reads then releases its
source, and publishes the destination after release when `D == S`. Do not emit destination values
192..255; EXP-0168's complete raw matrix places the first invalid encoding at 192.

**⚠️ Rounding: the ALU pack path and the PBE store path round DIFFERENTLY. Do not reuse one
rule for the other.**

- **`pack_float_to_unorm2x16` ties round to NEAREST-EVEN** (revalidated). All 16 pack semantic
  vectors matched an RTE oracle exactly, including three exact ties built with `Fraction`
  arithmetic. The competing pre-registered model — ties round **down**, as EXP-0133 measured for
  the `unorm16` **storage** path (see [`../descriptors/format-table.md`](../descriptors/format-table.md)
  §2e) — is **REFUTED for this instruction**.
- **fp16 narrowing matched IEEE round-to-nearest-even throughout**, including the `65520.0`
  overflow tie that must carry to `+inf`, subnormals, and NaN/Inf.
- ⛔ **`cvt_bf16` rounding: NOT ESTABLISHED, claim withdrawn.** The contaminated run showed every
  bfloat vector (including three exact bf16 ties) matching an RNE oracle and refuting a
  truncate-toward-zero model; that capture is inadmissible and the revalidation shard **never
  ran**. Reported as an open question with a strong prior, **not** a result.
- ⛔ **`packed_half2_hi`: NOT ESTABLISHED, claim withdrawn.** It could not be provoked from any
  MSL shape tried and is reachable only by an encoding assembled from `db.json`. All five of its
  fields are **`untested`**.

### ✅ Wrap-up decode: vertex varying-store + texcoord math (EXP-0037, closes census graphics gaps)
- **Vertex varying-store `0x57`** (8 B, memory family, sibling of `0x67/0xe7/0xd7`): the VS writes `[[position]]` +
  varyings to the UVS/parameter buffer that the FS `iter` op interpolates. **byte+3 = source GPR**, **byte+4 =
  output slot (`index<<5`)** — HW-validated (redirecting a store slot moved that varying to a different FS channel).
  **Position vs varying = the slot range** (position = slots 0–3, user varyings 4+), not a distinct opcode.
- **Not stores:** `0x05` = `psel` (computes per-vertex varying *values*, already in DB); `0x06` = the `0f06`
  reconverge sub-op / resync noise next to mesh `0xe7` emit. Mesh emits via `0xe7`, not `0x57`.
- **`0xb0`/`0x90` = the 10-byte sampler op** (second half of the EXP-0016 14-byte texture bundle) — a **tokenizer
  gating fix, not a missing instruction**: the `tex_sample` companion gate required `byte+1==0x80` exactly and missed
  chained-companion forms; fix widens to `(byte+1 & 0xf0)==0x80`.
- **`0x2e`/`0x26`/`0x92` = float fused-multiply coordinate math** (also the vertex `mvp*pos` product) — a **length-rule
  fix, not a missing instruction**: op-select `0x26/0x2e` are 6/8-byte (by byte+4 bit1); the naive float length rule
  mis-lengthed them. *(fixes + `vary_store` descriptor from `experiments/EXP-0037-varying-texmath/new_descriptors.json`, now merged.)*

### ✅ RT tail + tensor completion (EXP-O2C, objective-2 O2-C/O2-F)
- **RT-from-render (HW-validated):** a fragment shader tracing rays lowers **identically to compute RT** (2×`rt_intersect`
  + `0xdf` loads + `0x5f` + the −88B traversal loop); only the bind stage differs (`setFragmentAccelerationStructure:`).
  No fragment-specific RT opcode.
- **Motion blur (end-to-end HW-validated; sub-fields ⏳ inferred):** no new opcode — a motion-AS ray with time
  produces `rt_intersect` byte+2=`0x10` (dynamic/time form) and byte+4=`0xbb`, with the time value threaded via
  byte+3 and ~5 extra `0xdf` loads for time-interpolated vertices; interpolated hit distances validated
  (z=3→5 over 5 times). ⚠ **The `0xbb`/`0x8b`/`0x1b` byte+4 AS-select and byte+2 mode are byte-diff
  correlations, NOT splice-validated** — RT-5 showed splicing them on a single-primitive path is inert (see
  the `rt_intersect` sub-field caveat above); the motion path itself is validated by the interpolated
  distances, but the *specific byte that selects it* is inferred.
- **`0x5f` = RT ray-data memory op** (14 B, byte+2=`0x54`, sibling of `0xdf`) — the `ray_data` payload path (distinct
  address space in RT scratch; count scales with payload size). Also `rt_transform_test` (`0x?2`, byte+2=`0x27`, traversal
  slab-test ALU) and `ray_move` (`0x?b`, byte+2=`0x80/81`, 4 B ray-register marshalling). Primitive tag (bbox/curve/opacity)
  does **not** change the intersect op — discrimination is in the AS + `intersection_function_table`.
- **Tensor ops all lower to `0xcf`** (no new tensor opcode); transpose/load/store are memory + 4 B moves — the MAC is the
  only dedicated silicon. **Full `0xcf` operand decode (HW-validated via splice):** byte+5 = A(left) reg, byte+6 = B(right)
  reg, byte+7 = C accumulator, byte+8 = dst, byte+3 = A sub-descriptor, byte+10 = op-enable `0x24`, byte+11 bit0 =
  accumulate-enable, byte+1 = dtype, **byte+2 = mode (SEMANTIC, not a hint** — tiled mode `0x54` sources its accumulator
  from the MPP tile context; resolves EXP-0022's open question). *(descriptors from `experiments/EXP-O2C-rt-tensor-tail/new_descriptors.json`, now merged.)*

### ✅ Compute/fragment ISA tail (EXP-O2D, objective-2 O2-D/O2-E)
- **Atomic ordering = fence *presence*, not a field on the RMW op.** MSL accepts only `memory_order_relaxed` on
  `atomic_*_explicit`; the `0x67` RMW carries no ordering field. `atomic_thread_fence` = the **`0x07` fence family**:
  device fence `07 04 54 84 0a 00` (byte+3=`0x84` device, byte+4=`0x0a`); texture fence pair `07 04 54 50/d0 06 00`
  (byte+4=`0x06`, byte+3 bit7 = acquire/release). Relaxed / thread / simdgroup / threadgroup scope → no fence emitted.
  **API-behavior qualification (EXP-0051, M4, commit `adfa33b3`):** correctly fenced and deliberately relaxed,
  `mem_none`, or wrong-memory-class authored cases all passed the bounded Metal litmus, so those weak-control
  passes do not prove a portable ordering guarantee or identify native fence necessity. Consumer-first
  unsynchronized queues exposed stale data, while explicit event/CPU ordering passed. This adds no native-byte,
  Linux UAPI, cache-domain, or A18 semantics; see
  `../../experiments/EXP-0051-m4-synchronization-litmus/analysis/{summary.json,report.txt}`.
- **⚠ 64-bit atomics are ENTIRELY absent from MSL** (all `atomic<ulong/long/uint64_t>` ops rejected) — **corrects
  EXP-0018's "min/max only".** No reachable 64-bit atomic ⇒ no width field; **Vulkan int64 atomics must be emulated.**
- **bfloat ALU = distinct group byte0 `0x11`** (opsel byte+2 `0x1c/1d/1e` add/mul/fma; scalar byte+1=`0x02`, bfloat2
  `0x04`; add/mul 8 B, fma 10 B) — NOT fp32-lowered, NOT the `0x10` fp16 group. Splice `0x1c→0x1d` flipped bf 1+2→1×2.
  Includes a **length-rule fix** (DB mis-lengths `0x11` as 6 B).
- **Subgroup tail:** float `simd_product` = `0xbf` byte+1=`0x06`, byte0 bit7=1 (HW-validated, product↔sum); integer
  product/prefix-product have **no native op** (lowered to `0x47` shuffle + `0x9f` mul tree). `simd_shuffle_and_fill_up/
  down` = `0x47/0xc7` byte+1=`0x06`; **`simd_is_helper_thread` = `get_sr` SR byte1=`0x84`**.
- **Imageblock:** write = `0xe7` store, read = `0x67` load (fragment/tile variant byte+1 ∈ {`0x06`,`0x16`,`0x0e`});
  **slice addressing byte+5 = (field byte-offset within imageblock) >> 1** (differs from MRT's `rt<<1`); byte+7 = format.
  HW-validated end-to-end (tile kernel overwrote an RGBA16F attachment).
- **Tile shaders submit mid-render** (no separate submission): draw vs draw+`dispatchThreadsPerTile` = byte-identical
  IOKit (58 calls / 37 BOs); the tile-dispatch record is appended inline to the render control stream (`0x58000`/`0x18000`).

## ✅ NIR back-end option contract — what a portable NIR→Apple9 backend must assume (EXP-0121) — `target: G16G`

Evidence label **`HW-PROBE` + `OWN-SHADER`**, `target: G16G` (local Apple M4; A18 deferred).
Source: `experiments/EXP-0121-m4-nir-contract/RESULTS.md`, commit `1143ec55`. These are the
compiler-facing option answers, measured on hardware rather than assumed. `OPT-02` and `OPT-09`
are answered elsewhere in the gaps document.

| item | verdict | what the back-end must do |
|---|---|---|
| **OPT-01** — does preserving `fdiv` let legalization pick two distinct sequences? | **YES** | Relaxed and precise division compile to **structurally distinct** sequences — **66 vs 300 bytes**; a single `fspecial` SFU estimate versus `fspecial` **plus** a multi-instruction integer-domain refinement block. Confirms **`.lower_fdiv = false`**. Note the selector is the `fast::`/precise **namespace**, not the global compile flag alone. |
| **OPT-03** — does `pow` need a fixup beyond `exp2(y·log2(x))`? | **YES** | The naive composition returns **NaN for 22 of 53 directed edge cases** (negative base, zero base, zero exponent) that `pow` gets IEEE/C99-correct, and `pow`'s compiled body is **~27× larger (2102 vs 76 bytes)**. Confirms **`.lower_fpow = false`**: a target `pow` pseudo (or equivalent multi-instruction special-case lowering) is **required** — a bare `exp2(mul(log2))` glue is wrong. |
| **OPT-04** — is dynamic-exponent `ldexp(x,n)` one executable instruction? | **PARTIAL / NO** as a single instruction; **YES** numerically | The dedicated `fldexp` opcode in `db.json` was **never observed** across 4 fresh compile variants with runtime `n`; the compiler emits a **~200-byte integer-bit-manipulation composition** instead. That composition is numerically correct — **451/452 exact** against a DAZ+FTZ-adjusted oracle, the sole residual being a boundary-rounding edge at the exact min-normal/max-subnormal threshold. **Do not set `.has_ldexp = true`** on this evidence; assume a multi-instruction legalization. |
| **OPT-05** — can one instruction choose between two arbitrary register values? | **YES** | All **18** (type × condition) cases compile to exactly **one** fused instruction — `isel8`, in a 7-instruction 86-byte kernel — whose `selTrue`/`cmpA`/`cmpB` are **independent register operands carrying arbitrary, far-apart non-Boolean sentinels**. Enables **`.has_fused_comp_and_csel = true`**. |
| **OPT-06** — does that fused form cover every NIR condition and type? | **YES** | The same `isel8` serviced **FP32, signed I32 and unsigned I32** for all six of `eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge`, including signed/unsigned-distinguishing bit-pattern pairs — **825/825 corpus rows** match the host oracle. **Caveat:** `cc`'s `db.json` enum lists only 7 of the values actually observed, and the `cmp_mode` field's bit-level semantics are `INTERPRETED`, not measured. |
| **OPT-07** — can a varying be read at a dynamically indexed slot? | **NO** (bounded structural negative), functionally correct via ALU-select | `iter`/`iter_flat`'s slot field is a **compile-time immediate in every observed instance** (0, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 — small constants, **never a register**). Dynamic 8-way indexing — extending EXP-0111 FS-10's 4-way test — reads **every** candidate through its own fixed-slot interpolation and selects with ALU, **8/8 exact**. Lower `support_indirect_inputs` as "materialize every candidate statically, select via ALU". No register-sourced slot path exists even at 8 candidates. |
| **OPT-08** — can a fragment output be written at a dynamically indexed slot? | **UNKNOWN / PARTIAL mechanism**, positive-leaning structure | A genuinely per-fragment-divergent 2-way **and** 3-way `[[color(n)]]` output each compile to exactly **ONE** `frag_color_store` with `rt_index = 0` (immediate) — **not** scaling 1:1 with target count, which is what the pre-registered falsifier needed for a clean negative — yet hardware readback proves correct, independent routing to 2 and 3 distinct render targets. **But MSL offers no syntax to request a dynamic-output store** (array-typed fragment-output structs are rejected, EXP-0111). **A back-end must still lower a portable dynamically-indexed fragment output as a branch/select chain over static `[[color(n)]]` outputs.** Flagged for a dedicated follow-up; this does not license a NIR-level dynamic-output primitive. |
| **OPT-10** — does a plain aligned load satisfy atomic-load ordering under fences? | **NO** | An ordinary aligned load does **not** reliably observe a cross-thread write **even surrounded by `atomic_thread_fence(mem_device, seq_cst, thread_scope_device)`**. Every combination with a plain consumer load showed massive producer/consumer timeouts at every `PAIRS ≥ 1` in both runs (e.g. `AP_fenced` at `PAIRS = 1`: **300/300 iterations never completed**, both runs), while the identical protocol with an **atomic** consumer load is fast and 100 % clean at every scale. **A compiler must NOT lower an atomic load to a plain load, fenced or not.** |
| **OPT-11** — does a plain aligned store satisfy atomic-store ordering under fences? | **YES** | A plain store observed by a **trusted atomic** load is **0 mismatches / 100 % completion** at every `PAIRS ∈ {1,4,8,16}`, both runs, and its unfenced control **breaks at `PAIRS ≥ 4`** exactly as required. A plain store **is** an acceptable substitute for an atomic store when paired with the documented device-scope fence. |

> **The joint gate fails, asymmetrically. `has_atomic_load_store` must be `false`** — it needs

**Explicit limitations (do not read past them):** OPT-04 tested only the exact
`ldexp(x[gid], n[gid])` idiom plus a uniform-`n` variant; OPT-06's `cmp_mode` bit-level semantics
are `INTERPRETED` from a field-interaction pattern, not measured; OPT-07/08 did **not** test
vertex-stage output-slot indexing (writing a varying *from* the vertex stage at a dynamic slot).
Everything here is **M4/G16G**; A18/G17P is deferred.

**The structural one — read this before trusting any sweep site in this document:**

- **`isadb.decode_one` answers "do these bytes match a descriptor". It NEVER answers "does an
  instruction start here."** A stop-ruler scan (write a `stop` at every offset on a 2-byte grid;
  a halt proves a boundary the hardware honours) found **0 of 7 signature-derived occurrences were
  boundaries**. `n4_rt_word` `04 <dst> 20 80` is byte **+6 of a 10-byte instruction** (3/3 sites);
  `rtq_pred` `06 c2 00 00` likewise; `n4_cf_word` `04 01 00 00` is byte **+2 of the 6-byte
  `pop_reconverge`** (3/4). This mechanically explains DEF-0172-4 — that experiment's 256-value
  `b3` sweep was sweeping byte +5 of a `pop_reconverge`. Same shape as `cubearray_coord_const`
  being **shadowed by `pad_operand`** at an interior boundary (EXP-0204), found the same day by a
  different method. Now a protocol precondition (`FIELD-SWEEP-PROTOCOL.md` §3z). (EXP-0200)

**Documented rules that are WRONG:**

- **`tex_sample.mode` is a BITFIELD, not the documented enum, and `0x10` ("filtered sample") is
  INERT** — splicing `0x10`↔`0x00` leaves the observation bit-identical on all five representative
  arms in both runs. Exact live rule, zero exceptions on the six 100%-agreement arms:
  `(mode & 0x2C) != 0`. Bit 3 live everywhere; **bit 2 live exactly where a filter is used; bit 5
  live exactly where the LOD is implicit** (inert under explicit `level()`). The pre-registered
  enum model was refuted 1/30. *Derived after the sweep → hypothesis, not a result.* (EXP-0204)
- **`ret`/`ret_luse.linkmode`'s accepted set is `v & 3 == 2` (64/256), NOT `v & 7 == 4`** — and
  **`0x04`/`0x05`, which `db.json` calls `cf_merge`, FAULT**. Within the accepted set **bit 4 =
  restore-link**: at a non-leaf return 32 values are correct (bit 4 set) and 32 give one identical
  *coherent wrong* payload; at both leaf returns all 64 are correct. (EXP-0206)
- **`falu3.op` low-3 class 5 is `0.0 * b`, NOT a constant zero** — the result's sign follows srcB
  and an infinite srcB yields NaN. Classes 4 (`-b`), 6 (`a*b+c`), 7 (no output) confirmed
  bit-exactly; classes 0/1/2 refuted on a 3-source carrier. **`falu3_ext.op` accepts exactly
  `(v & 0xC7) == 0x06` — the two `op` fields DO NOT share an operation map**, though `db.json`
  carries one identical note on both. (EXP-0201)
- **`vary_slot`'s declared semantics are refuted** — `slot` produced **zero relocations** across
  256 values × 2 captures, while the positive control `vary_store.out_slot` matched `index<<5` on
  26/32 with six exact predicted relocations on the same observable. (EXP-0199)
- **`pop_reconverge.reserved` is not reserved** — its **low byte must be zero** (9 zero-low-byte
  values correct; 43 non-zero all give one identical wrong payload); high byte inert over 9
  values. **Gate E MET for this row** (quiet pair). (EXP-0206)
- **`tex_write.rsv10` is the write's mip LEVEL, not reserved.** (EXP-0204)
- **`frame_marker_compact`: the 4-byte form is correct where it was tested, and the 2-byte length
  in `db.json` was NOT changed — both facts are load-bearing and an emitter needs both.** By
  insertion: `60 XX` is correct at **0/7** boundaries and 0/254 byte+1 values, while `60 XX 00 00`
  is correct at **7/7**, and the control `00 00 00 00` is correct at only 2/7 so a 4-byte insertion
  is not automatically benign (EXP-0199). **But applying 2 -> 4 to the tokenizer was REFUSED as a
  MEASURED CORPUS REGRESSION** (EXP-0212): clean files **841 -> 838**, strict leftover **+410
  bytes**, instructions **25,634 -> 25,565 (-69)**. The reconciliation is the scope EXP-0199 stated
  about itself — its 7 boundaries were insertions into **straight-line COMPUTE carriers**, whereas
  the corpus `60 00 <nonzero>` sites are **threadgroup-atomic and divergent-control-flow**
  contexts it did not re-test. So: **emit the 4-byte form only in the straight-line compute context
  where it was measured; do not assume it globally, and do not expect our tokenizer to accept it.**
- **`sfu_marker` accepts 8 of the 32 values `db.json` declares** — exactly `(b0 & 0x1f) == 0x06`.
  `0x0e` satisfies the declared match but is `stop`. (EXP-0199)
- **`frag_depth_store`'s byte+2 declared match `0x54` is NOT ENFORCED AT ALL** (256/256 ok, both
  carriers), and byte+1's declared full-byte match `0x14` needs only 2 bits. (EXP-0199)
- **`get_sr.dst_hi` does NOT extend the destination register on G17P.** The register-dump carrier
  proves a relocated write *is* visible — `dst`→10 clobbers codeword slot 9, `dp_width`→0x50
  clobbers slot 8 — while `dst_hi` across 8/8 clobbers nothing. **`dp_width` is itself a bitfield,
  not the documented 4-value enum.** (EXP-0207)
- **`simd_reduce.op` decodes only bits [2:0]**; bits [7:3] are inert-within-field on all four
  carriers and the observation repeats with period 8 across the full 256-value sweep. **`op` and
  `dtype` are NOT independent** — the `{0,1,2,3} → {ior,isum,smax,umax}` map holds at `opcls=1,
  dtype=3`, but at `dtype=7` op 0 and 3 return exclusive-scan shapes. (EXP-0205)

**New emitter-usable rules:**

- **`irotate`: `byte+6 = 4 * (32 - K)` gives rotate-LEFT-by-K.** Independently of the model,
  searching all 32 amounts recovers a single amount at exactly the 33 modelled values — **32
  distinct amounts, zero formula disagreements** over 3212 (arm,value) pairs. The prior `UNSTABLE`
  refusal does not reproduce (0/3212 disagree). (EXP-0202)
- **`cvt_f2i` SATURATES**: `int(2^31 + 2^8)` returns `0x7FFFFFFF`. byte+7 is a width + sign +
  **saturation-bound** descriptor (7-way map), refining the older "bit 6 = signed vs unsigned".
  (EXP-0202)
- **`half_pack` writes the destination's HIGH 16 bits and preserves the LOW 16**, and **zeroes
  both named source half-lanes** — a side effect none of the seven pre-registered candidate models
  predicted. Its `dstlo`/`b3` are **SOURCE half-register descriptors**, and because `db.json` pins
  all eight bits of byte0, **every db-expressible encoding writes `r1`**. (EXP-0203)
- **`half_alu_fma12.ext` hides a third fp16 source at bits 40..47** (`srcC`, 256/256 oracle match
  on 3 arms, bit 7 a measured don't-care); bits 32..33 are the length selector and 34..39
  modifiers. Nothing is declared inert — byte+10 reads dead on one carrier and moves on two others
  *in the same runs*. (EXP-0203)
- **`get_sr.form` is a read-enable CONDITIONAL ON `dp_width`** — inert at `dp_width` 0x10 on 6/6
  arms, live at 0x14 on 5/5 non-vertex arms, and the effect follows the field into carriers whose
  compiler chose 0x10. At 0x14, `form=1` makes the read contribute exactly zero:
  `out(form=1) == out(form=0) - lane*65536` for all 64 lanes. (EXP-0207)
- **A mid-program `stop` terminates, and the final `stop` IS executed** — byte 0 → `0x0f`/`0x8f`
  faults reproducibly on 3 carriers in 2 runs while 6 other values are harmless. This bounds the
  older claim that corrupting any of it is a no-op. (EXP-0206)
- **Denormals are flushed to zero by the `falu3` FMA** (operand and/or result). (EXP-0201)

**Hazard walls (capability-map facts, first-class per §6):**

- **The `0xC0` destination wall is ISA-WIDE, not a `frag_color_pack` quirk.** The same `v >= 0xC0`
  wall appears independently on `ibitcount.dst`, `irotate.operands`, `ibfe.b2_bit0` and
  `ibfe.sign_ext` across three experiments — **`dst[7:6] == 0b11` is likely illegal generally**,
  encodable range 192. Confirmed on hardware for `ibitcount.dst`: 64 contiguous values fault,
  mapped with no abort path and no hangs. M4's hole at 242 does **not** reproduce on G17P.
  (EXP-0208, EXP-0202)
- **`n4_rt_word.dst` faults exactly on `{v : (v & 0b110) == 0b100}`** — 6/6 carrier-runs, 384
  fault + 1152 clean, zero exceptions, extended to a carrier the original experiment never
  measured. *But V=1 per carrier: every accepted value returns the same answer, so the movement is
  entirely the wall, and the swept byte is +7 of a 10-byte instruction.* (EXP-0200)
- **`tex_deriv.dstsrc`'s hazard family:** `0x03FFFF, 0x07FFFF, 0x0FFFFF, 0x1FFFFF, 0x3FFFFF,
  0x7FFFFF, 0xFFFFFE, 0xFFFFFF` plus `0xFBEEE7`. Mapped and excluded, the cross-run partition is
  exactly reproducible. A per-field hang budget of 2 could never attribute this. (EXP-0204)
- **Inserting the 2-byte word `01 00` at a `k_line` boundary hung the GPU 5/5 times.** Device
  recovered every time. (EXP-0199)

**Fields that are `carrier-undecidable` — NOT inert:**

- **`shift_amt_move.src_flag`** — nine carriers spanning seven operand-producer classes, 768
  byte-identical comparisons. The deciding instrument was the sibling `b_alu10_lo7.src_flag`: same
  bit, same enum, same family, and one the compiler emits at **both** values — also inert, while
  its own `src_reg` control moves at 19/20. The harness has not been shown able to see a
  source-class change at all. (EXP-0202)
- **`mesh_out_src.sel`** — dispatched for the first time ever (a mesh-pipeline sweep runner had to
  be written), but its frame can only be **destroyed**, never moved to a different valid payload.
  (EXP-0207)
- **`dev_scoreboard_fence.scope_flag`**, **`n1_word`/`n2_compact2`/`n3_word`**. (EXP-0207, EXP-0200)

**And one inert result that survived a real litmus:** `simd_ballot.cache` stayed inert through a
multi-invocation ordering litmus (4 threadgroups × 2 simdgroups, cross-simdgroup exchange, a
cross-threadgroup atomic checked against a host total) with its in-dimension control firing —
recorded as *inert in the exact tested envelope; global role unknown*, with two unexercised
dimensions named. Its sibling **`simd_shuffle.cache` is LIVE and contextual**: clearing byte+2
bit 1 where the compiler set it returns **foreign data** or a silent zero with a wrong atomic
total, isolated by a matched pair differing only in **operand provenance**. (EXP-0205)


### 2026-08-30 descriptor identity — corrections an emitter MUST have (EXP-0216/0217)

> These are **descriptor-geometry and semantics** facts derived from committed bytes and
> already-controlled oracles. No evidence label changed. Where a question is undecidable it says so
> rather than guessing.

- **`imad` has NO `srcA` field, and BOTH its operand bytes are multiplicands.**
  `dest = SEED[b5>>2] * SEED[b6>>3] + 1` fits **64/64 and 68/128**, while **both addend models fit
  0**. So an earlier repair moved the wrong *name* (`srcC_lo`, byte 6 → byte 5) instead of removing
  it. **Which multiplicand is A and which is B is UNDECIDABLE** — multiplication commutes and no
  observation separates them. **The addend is still unaccounted for.** Byte+5 is a multiplicand
  selector with `reg = v>>2` (oracle 64/64); the descriptor's own note previously read "ROLE
  UNRESOLVED — never swept", which its own sidecar contradicted with "byte+5: 0..255 dense, 512
  records".
- **`fspecial`'s operand rotation is real and correct.** Byte 3 relocates the **destination**
  (`index = v>>1`); byte 5 selects and releases the **source** (`index = v>>2`). EXP-0237 closes
  the direct-round materialized-GPR envelope densely: destination byte 0..191 reaches r0..r95,
  and all 256 source-byte values reach r0..r63 four times. The `(12,4)` field is inert in the
  earlier tested carriers.
- **`falu3` is `A*B+C` reading bytes 1/3/5, with `reg = byte>>1`** — not the frozen model, which
  put srcB on byte 4 whose baseline `0x81` is register 64. **EXP-0203's own committed oracle scores
  47,030 for bytes 1/3/5 against 0 for bytes 3/4/5.** The same shape holds for `iminmax`,
  `half_alu` and `half_alu_fma12`.
- **`mov_zext16`: byte0 = `0xN3` writes `zext16(r[N])` into `r[N]`** — the same register is source
  and destination, verified against the committed pre-dump for N = 0..10; N >= 11 writes nothing.
- **Two descriptor `match` constraints are OVER-FIT and will reject encodings the hardware runs.**
  `cvt_f2h` spends 8 bits on byte 0 when only the **low nibble** (the opcode group) holds — it
  fails **6,550 of 6,555** committed encodings, and the low nibble holds on **6,515** of them; the
  high nibble is a `dst` register in every dst-parameterised sibling. `bf_alu` is worse:
  **0 of 13,144** committed encodings satisfy it (`byte1 == 0x00` on all 13,144 where the match
  wants `0x02`). **Neither match was widened**, because every candidate widening either broke
  round-trip or let one descriptor swallow another's firings — see below.
- **`bf_alu`, `bf_add_dst` and `bf_mul_dst` assign IDENTICAL spans per swept byte** (byte 3 =
  `srcA (24,8)`, byte 4 = `srcB`, bytes 5–7 = `tail (40,24)`). An apparent sibling-mnemonic
  conflict was an artefact of aggregating field counts across bytes 3–7.

**Why the over-fit matches were NOT fixed — this is a fact about the ISA, not only about us.**
All three candidate widenings leave the corpus decode *bit-identical* in clean files, leftover
bytes, instructions and resync gap. What refuses them is finer: widening `cvt_f2h` breaks
round-trip once and adds a field with no evidence; widening `bf_alu` breaks it twice and, tying
`bf_alu8_var` at four match bits, **wins on list order and swallows all 135 of that descriptor's
firings**; and the bfloat byte+2 masking recovers 112 records while **0 of the 37 corpus tokens it
re-claims carry `byte+1 == 0x00`**, the only byte+1 the hardware alias sweep held.

**And the underlying reason is context-dependence.** `0x14` is in the eight-value bfloat alias set
**and** is the byte+2 of the hardware-validated convert anchor `01 01 14 81 04 02`. The same byte+2
value means different things in different groups, so a mask that is correct for one group is wrong
for the other. An emitter must not treat these bits as a free-standing enum.


### `imad`'s addend — TWO modes, selected by byte+9 bit 3 (EXP-0218, `target: G16G`+`G17P`)

**An emitter must choose the mode explicitly; there is no single "addend field".**

```
K      = (b7 >> 3) & 0x1F          hi3 = b8 & 7
IMM8   = K | (hi3 << 5)            -- 8 bits, 0..255
sel    = (b9 >> 3) & 1             -- 0 : addend = IMM8      (value IS in the instruction)
                                   -- 1 : addend = FILE[K]   (external scalar file; NOT in it)
width  = b9 & 1                    -- FETCH MODE ONLY: 0 = 16-bit half, 1 = 32-bit word
                                   -- 32-bit fetch = FILE[K] | (FILE[K+1] << 16)
```

**This reconciles two claims in this repository that flatly contradicted each other, and retracts
neither.** EXP-M4-13 R6 recorded "the immediate is in the instruction"; DEF-0160-3 recorded "the
addend is not in the instruction". **Both are correct — each in its own mode.** Both were merely
stated as general. The two anchors the corpus was built on differ in **exactly two bytes**, byte+7
and byte+9, and byte+9 differs by **exactly bit 3**:

| anchor | bytes | mode |
|---|---|---|
| M4 | `9f 00 56 00 02 08 00 38 d0 `**`26`**` 0a 00` | immediate |
| G17P | `9f 00 56 00 02 08 00 60 d0 `**`2e`**` 0a 00` | fetch |

**Evidence.** The model was frozen before fitting and scores **381/382 on G16G** and
**1832/1832 HELD OUT on G17P**. Every immediate-only alternative — including `db.json`'s own
`(b8 & 0xF) << 5 | K` — scores **42/1832**; fetch-only scores **0/10** on the M4 population; the
best of 45 register models scores **167/4126**. The mode switch is **156/156 vs 0/128** on G16G
and 10/10 on G17P. The 32-bit form was predicted **out-of-sample** from the 16-bit table: **6/6**
and **2/2**. It is not a register by four independent tests — 384/384 encodings give an identical
addend under both G17P seed sets, one scalar addend explains all 8 M4 lanes, and 2360/2361 are
launch-stable.

**All four earlier bounds have now been dispatched (EXP-0219) — three SETTLED, one narrowed:**

- **SETTLED: the selector is bit 3, and it is now G17P-DIRECT.** The whole low nibble was swept
  (`b9 in 0x20..0x2f` x `K in 0..31` x 2 seed sets). Every `bit3 == 0` value gives `A = IMM8`
  **64/64** — including **`0x22`**, which has bit 1 SET — and every `bit3 == 1` value gives
  `A = FILE[K]` **64/64** — including **`0x2c`**, which has bit 1 CLEAR. Whole-model `sel = bit3`
  scores **2054/2054** against **1040/2054** for `sel = bit1`. **Bits 1 and 2 are inert for the
  addend across the entire cross product.**
- **SETTLED: 32-bit fetch is a WORD, not a pair.** `word` scores 64/64 against `pair` 54/64 on one
  carrier and 64/64 against 38/64 on another, and **all 36 discriminating odd-K cases say word**.
  At K = 15 the destination is `0xB3D6BF95` — the carrier's own `-1e-7f`, recovered whole from an
  **odd** index, which a `(K, K+1)` pairing cannot produce.
- **SETTLED: the immediate branch is G17P-direct.** All 32 K at `b9 = 0x26` (64/64), and **all 256
  immediate values** via `b8 = 0xd0..0xd7` (512/512 per carrier per run).
- **NARROWED: the fetch index is AT LEAST 7 bits — the 5-bit reading is REFUTED, and the evidence
  for it was a CARRIER ARTEFACT.** A purpose-built carrier with 48 constants (96 distinct
  hand-chosen halves) reaches **half-index 75**, and fetch-mode sweeps return exactly what a
  prediction from *our own MSL source* says should be there — **190/224 held out, both runs** —
  while the same `b8` bits in *immediate* mode give `A = ((b8&7)<<5)|K` at **512/512**, proving
  those bits reach the instruction. **The old carrier reproduces the "suppression above index 31"
  artefact in the very same captures (0 of 512 non-zero): it was a property of that carrier's
  constant file, not of the instruction.** Still open: **bit 2 of the index (values >= 128)**,
  because no carrier's file reaches that far.

Related, from the same analysis: **`db.json`'s `mulsel[0:3]` is one bit too wide** — byte+8's
immediate high bits are 60/60 and bit 3 is not among them (8/8 flip pairs identical).


### `tex_sample.mode` bit 6 — periodic in the DISPATCH INDEX, not nondeterministic (EXP-0219)

**An emitter must not set bit 6.** That is the whole actionable rule; the rest is why.

Bit 6 was previously read as instability — it caused every cross-order disagreement in an earlier
Gate E attempt (53 of them, all at values with **bit 6 set and bit 3 clear**). It is not random.
Repeating each value **inside one process** — a measurement nobody had made — shows the payload is
a **strictly periodic function of the dispatch index**, smallest period **4 or 8**, over
**240/240 sequences with 0 aperiodic**, confirmed **out of sample at N = 24** (divisible by 4 and 8
but not 16). An interleaved run rotates the phase by one step per value, so **the phase follows the
GLOBAL dispatch counter**, not the value.

It is not our harness: with **one arm and one context** 32/32 are still unstable and 31/32 sit at
period exactly 4, and the matched **bit6-CLEAR twin set is 0 of 33 on every arm of every capture**.

**Bit 6 is live on 4 of 9 arms and inert on 5**, with the partition identical across all four
captures. The best predicate is *a chain of >= 3 samples, not the last* — recorded **`INFERRED`**,
with `mscmp/0` (first of a 2-chain, inert) named as the reason it is not stronger. Two of the inert
arms are the **last `tex_sample` of a 3-chain**, which no prior experiment had ever armed.

**Consequence for anyone re-testing this field: Gate E as payload-equality is UNMEETABLE for it on
any machine, quiet or not.** What reproduces is the *partition* and the *period structure* — so
score those, not the payload. **Semantics remain UNKNOWN.**


### 2026-08-31 rules CORRECTED by the first canonical recipe (EXP-0220, `target: G17P`)

> All seven were found **pre-freeze**, folded into the pre-registration, and then **re-measured**
> under the frozen contract — they are not post-hoc rationalisations of a passing run. The recipe
> that carries them is `falu2` at **620/620** with `COPIED = 0` and `CARRIER = 0` over 14,240,584
> field emissions.

- **`falu2.opflags` bit 1 is OPERAND-CLASS DEPENDENT — an emitter using one rule for both classes
  emits wrong code.** With a **GPR** `srcB` it is release-src1. With an **inline immediate** `srcB`
  it **NEGATES THE IMMEDIATE** (XOR with `srcB_neg`). This supersedes EXP-0090 finding_1 and
  explains EXP-0167's otherwise-unexplained `INLINE_NEG0_SIGN = -1`.
- **`falu2.mod_hi` bit 0 set ⇒ the destination is NOT WRITTEN AT ALL.** Bits 2+3 are an **in-flight
  load accept** control: `0xC` is required only while a load is still unlanded and is free after
  one intervening instruction. **`0xC` is the canonical value.**
- **`device_store.addr_mode` bit 1 is the store-side twin of the load rule: clear ⇒ it stores the
  STALE register AND DROPS THE LOAD.** This refines EXP-0141's "stores 0" — the store still
  happens, with the wrong data.
- **A `device_store` RELEASES its index register.** A second store reusing that register addresses
  with **index 0**, silently.
- **A store whose index register holds a live (unlanded) load result uses the STALE index.**
- **`device_store.extmode` bit 0 is NOT a don't-care** — only the **even** values 0..126 deliver
  `r(extmode/2)`.
- **NINE `mov_imm` immediates fail to tokenize, not one**: value 12, plus every `imm7 ≡ 6 (mod 16)`.

**Also measured:** `falu2.opsel` values 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 **fault**; denormal results **flush to
zero**. And two descriptor ambiguities that an emitter must route around: `falu2` opsel 0/1 collides
with `falu_compact4`, and **`device_store` space 6/22 collides with `frag_color_store` /
`imageblock_store` — which DESYNCS the length-rule walk**, so a stream containing one of those
values will mis-tokenize downstream.

**What the `falu2` recipe covers** (an emitter can rely on these): dst 16/16, `srcA_reg` 64/64,
`srcB_reg` 64/64, inline immediate 256/256 (64 codes × 2 signs × 2 ops), constant-zero classes 2
and 3, `opflags` 32/32 with a per-source re-read truth table, `mod_hi` 16/16 in two provenance
classes, both b32 **and** b16, and provenance {live load, ALU, `mov_imm`} × distance {0,1,2} =
60/60. **NOT covered: the uniform-register operand source** — 8 cases dispatched but not predicted.
Any value it supplies is reachable via a GPR or an inline immediate, both proven, so it is not an
emitter blocker; it stays open on the capability map.

**What `device_store` covers:** all six `st_format` shapes byte-exactly (confirming element *n* =
register `extmode/2 + n`), the full 256-value `addr_mode` sweep in **both** data-source classes,
`extmode` 64/64 even 0..126, 30 index registers, 29 `idx_off` boundaries, all three bound slots.
**NOT covered: the threadgroup address space** — but **NOT for the reason EXP-0220 gave, and its
claim is withdrawn.** EXP-0220's RESULTS said "threadgroup-space stores fault, 4 of 4"; **its own
committed raw shows its `space` arm at 8 fault / 12 ok**, and a dense two-carrier sweep (EXP-0221)
gives **64 of 256 faulting, exactly `space & 0x06 == 0x06`, byte-identical with and without a
threadgroup allocation** — so the faults are not a threadgroup property at all. The threadgroup
class **executes and writes the tile**, with an address law pre-registered as a boolean before the
run and confirmed **80/80**: the codeword arrives iff **`load_idx_off == 4 x store_idx_off`** (8
deliver, 72 silent), which is EXP-0100's 16-byte-store / 4-byte-load asymmetry measured on G17P
**from bytes we generated** rather than by splicing Apple-emitted ones. `base_slot = 16` is the
selector — exactly **one** store config of 792 delivered. **The real blocker is narrower: no single
generated `device_load` reads the tile back.** Only a 16-entry bank of *differing* descriptors
does — 0/14, 0/3,336 and 0/1,596 across three attempts. **`extmode >= 128` is CLOSED** (see below).


### `device_store.extmode` is a 16-bit HALF-REGISTER index that WRAPS MOD 96 (EXP-0221)

Even `2R` stores `r(R)`; **odd values straddle two registers**; and **the register index wraps
mod 96** — `extmode` 192–255 reproduce 0–63 byte for byte, and `extmode` 191 reads r95's high half
with r0's low half above it. This **closes EXP-0220's `extmode >= 128` gap** and refutes that
experiment's own H6 (128 failures). One part is unresolved: the **odd-index top half is
operand-provenance dependent**.

**`index_reg` bit 7 is IGNORED on both load and store**, including the release side effect, and the
fault set is identical on both: `(v & 0x7F) in 96..127` — i.e. values 96–127 and 224–255.

**`stop.reserved` is inert over 1,178 structured values** (sampled, and said so). And **EXP-0206's
control-flow-leader fault does NOT reproduce on G17P**: all six `0x0F`/`0x8F` bodies halted cleanly.

## Confirmed: this is a wholly different ISA from G13/G14
The public dougallj/applegpu (G13) decoder produces `<disassembly failed>` or nonsense on G17P
bytes. applegpu is therefore a **structural template + ISA-agnostic testbed**, not a decoder to
extend. The A18 instruction database is built from scratch (Phase 1).

## 2026-08-30 G17P wave — facts added from the emit/closure experiments

> Drafted by EXP-0186, which audited which results had reached this deliverable and found
> **20 of 22 emitter-facing facts missing or refuted-but-still-stated**. Every block below is
> traced to a committed experiment artifact, carries its evidence label and the **target it was
> measured on**, and keeps the bounds the measuring experiment stated. Where a result is
> deliberately bounded it says so; a doc that drops the bound is worse than no doc.

Added by the 2026-08-30 G17P wave — these are `target: G17P`, and the last one changes how the
list must be read:

- **The half-ALU family's destination is byte0's high nibble, and `db.json` models it as a
  source** — an emitter following the descriptor writes **`r1`** every time, with no fault
  (EXP-0180, DEF-0180-1).
- **`n3_mov`'s source-register field is one bit off in `db.json`** — write the register number
  where the descriptor says and the hardware reads register `S >> 1` at half `S & 1`: **the wrong
  register *and* the wrong half**, silently (EXP-0174, DEF-0174-1).
- **A `device_store` through an unbound binding slot is silently dropped** — 254 of 256
  `base_slot` values store nothing at all, with **0 faults and 0 hangs**, no stray write and no
  diagnostic. Binding validity must be guaranteed by construction in userspace (EXP-0169 §14).
- **`vary_store.hint6` bit 4 makes the entire fragment output read `0.0`** — the whole varying
  block is lost, not just the component being stored (EXP-0163 §4).
- **`tex_sample.coord` pointed at a register the program does not keep live** returns the
  previous result unchanged, never a fault — and the fragment-stage register index **aliases with
  period 16**, so a "safe-looking" high register is not safe (EXP-0172 §2.1).
- ⚠️ **`instance_id` is not base-inclusive while `vertex_id` is** — a back end that treats them
  alike gets instanced draws with a non-zero `baseInstance` silently wrong (EXP-0178 §3.5).

> **And the premise sharpened: absence of a fault is not evidence the operation happened.**
> Across **256 `rt_index` values on four `tile_read`/`tile_read_mrt` carriers in two gated runs
> there is not a single fault** (EXP-0178 §5), and the `device_store` unbound-slot sweep produced
> **0 faults and 0 hangs over its full 256-value range** (EXP-0169 §14) — a hazard its own
> pre-registration had warned was the likeliest thing left to wedge the device. **A status code
> can never be the oracle on this hardware; the read-back must be poisoned before the run and
> checked after it.** Two instruction families, two experiments, same conclusion.

- ⛔ **The half-ALU family's DESTINATION is byte0's high nibble, and `db.json` models it as a
  source — an emitter following the descriptor can only ever write `r1`.** `target: G17P`.
  For the `0x10`/`0x11` leaders (`half_alu`, `half_alu_ext8`, `half_alu_fma12`):

  | field | what it actually is |
  |---|---|
  | **byte0 high nibble** | **destination register `n`.** `byte0 = n<<4` writes **`r[n]`'s LOW 16 bits** and **preserves `r[n]`'s HIGH 16 bits** |
  | `db.json`'s `dst` (bits 8..15) | appears in the arithmetic as a **SOURCE** |
  | byte+4 | does **not** appear in the arithmetic at all — it is the **length selector** (see the length rule below) |

  `db.json` pins all eight bits of byte0 in `match`, so a descriptor-driven emitter has no way
  to name a destination and every half-ALU result lands in `r1`. There is no fault: the program
  runs and writes the wrong register. Confirmed **three independent ways** on G17P — a dense
  destination-nibble sweep (`n = 0..15`, 16/16, two carriers, both gated runs, 100.0000%
  agreement); structurally (the seed program's 14 low-half writes land in `r_j` in **every one of
  33,470 gated cases**); and arithmetically (`r1.lo = 0x470f = 1.625 × 2.59375 + 2.84375` =
  byte+3 × byte+1 + byte+5). Two nibbles are excluded with cause and are harness artefacts, not
  exceptions: `n=15` is the store index register the harness re-seeds, and on the low carrier
  `n=13` is the second-consumer destination. This is the same defect class already documented one
  family over for `mov_zext16`, `n3_mov`, `cvt_f2h_dst` and `falu3`. `EXP-0180` (DEF-0180-1).

- ⛔ **Three exact, contiguous illegal-encoding regions found by sweeps that deliberately ran
  without a hang budget.** `target: G17P`. Each was mapped over the *full* 256-value range with
  zero counterexamples; a per-field budget of 2 would have reported "two bad values" for all
  three (see `experiments/FIELD-SWEEP-PROTOCOL.md` §3(c)).

  | field | rule | region | class |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `frag_color_pack.dst` | `dst[7:6] == 0b11` | `0xC0`–`0xFF`, **64 values** | **HANG** — `0x00`–`0xBF` are all clean, so the real encodable range is **192, not 256** |
  | `device_store.index_reg` | `(v & 0x60) == 0x60` | `0x60`–`0x7F` and `0xE0`–`0xFF`, **64 values** | fault (bit 7 is a don't-care — the `0x00`–`0x7F` map repeats exactly in `0x80`–`0xFF`) |
  | `device_store.extmode` | `v >= 0xFC` | `0xFC`–`0xFF`, **4 values** | fault |
  | `half_alu*.opflags` | `(byte+2 >> 3) >= 16 ∧ (byte+2 & 7) ∈ {4,5}` | opflags bit 4 set with `opsel` = hadd or hmul | fault, 128 cases, zero counterexamples |

  The three fault walls are **faults, not hangs** — per-command-buffer errors, fault-contained,
  no reset and no wedge, with the sweeps running through them at full speed. The
  `frag_color_pack.dst` wall **is** hangs: 64 of them, and the device survived all 64 with no
  reset. `EXP-0168` §8.1, `EXP-0169` §15, `EXP-0180` §4.

- ⛔ **In a VERTEX shader every `sr_sel` with bit 7 clear FAULTS the command buffer** — all 128
  values `0x00`–`0x7F`, contiguous, zero counterexamples, both gated runs. Nothing at or above
  `0x80` faults in any stage. **A back end must never emit a bit-7-clear selector**, and must
  know that the failure mode is stage-dependent: **loud in vertex, near-silent in compute**,
  where the same encoding does not fault at all and instead writes **one lane of 64**, leaving
  the other 63 untouched. The single-lane effect is the *whole program* retiring one invocation,
  not the SR datapath: an integrity sentinel written by a separate `device_store` carrying no
  SR value lands on that same single lane. `HW-VALIDATED`, `target: G17P`, `EXP-0178` §3.1–§3.3
  (256 values × 3 stage carriers × 2 gated runs, 100.00% cross-run agreement, zero
  disagreements).

  > **This REFINES `EXP-0092`; it does not refute it.** That exhaustive M4 sweep found no
  > `sr_sel` value raising `STATUS != OK` — and it ran on a **compute** carrier, which
  > `EXP-0178`'s compute arm reproduces exactly (0 faults in 256 values, both runs). **The
  > divergence is STAGE, not target.** The M4 record is correct about what it measured. An
  > experiment can be exhaustive over the whole encodable range, densely swept and cross-run
  > agreed **and still be blind**, because one carrier cannot see a dimension it does not vary.

- ⚠ **`vertex_id` is base-inclusive in hardware; `instance_id` is NOT.** `0xdd` returns
  `index + baseVertex`; `0xd8` returns the **raw instance ordinal**, and `baseInstance` is added
  **in software**. A back end that assumes the two behave alike gets instanced draws with a
  non-zero `baseInstance` **silently wrong**. `HW-VALIDATED`, `target: G17P`, `EXP-0178` §3.5 —
  and the compiler-inserted constant was **measured, not assumed**: seven selectors with no
  vertex-stage meaning (`0x9c`, `0x9d`, `0x9e`, `0xa0`, `0xa1`, `0xa4`, `0xc5`) all read exactly
  `5`, seven independent zero-expectations agreeing on `K = baseInstance = 5`. Subtracting `K`,
  `0xdd` ramps `9, 10, 11` across three vertices (`baseVertex = 9`) and `0xd8` reads flat `2`.

  **Bounded, and the bound matters.** *In a vertex program that does not declare
  `[[base_vertex]]`/`[[base_instance]]`, selectors `0x88` and `0x8a` read 0 on G17P.* The
  alternative — that the driver only arms them when the shader declares the builtin — is **not
  excluded**, so this is deliberately **not** recorded as refuting the enum entry (unlike
  `0xa8`, where the shader asks for nothing and the register still contradicts its documented
  meaning). `EXP-0178`'s vertex arm is reported **differentially** for the same reason: its
  harness scored `0x8a` as correct because oracle and observation both said 5, which is a right
  answer for the wrong reason, and its two passes are not cited as validations of anything.

- **CALL is EMITTABLE — every byte generated, none copied.** `target: G17P`, `HW-VALIDATED`.
  192 distinct generated calls × 2 gated runs = **384/384 correct, zero faults, zero hangs, zero
  disagreements**; each `call`, callee and `ret` was produced from the descriptor's declared bit
  positions with nothing lifted from a compiled shader (`EXP-0179` §2–§3).

> **Confirmed on the documentation target, and the hazard is sharper than "no fault".**
> `EXP-0178` §5 re-measured every value set above on **G17P**, over **four** carriers (two per
> instruction, differing in attachment count, spatial extent, the arithmetic consuming the read,
> and the presence of a colour store that reads no tilebuffer at all) and two gated runs —
> 9,428 cases per run, zero measurement failures, zero innocent victims. The M4 sets were frozen
> into the analysis **before** the runs as the hypothesis under test, and **every one transfers
> unchanged**: `read_en` = byte+6 bit 0, `rt_index` correct only at `0x00/0x01/0x80/0x81`
> (`_mrt`: `0x08/0x09/0x88/0x89`), the `dst` fault wall **exactly `0xf6`–`0xff`, contiguous,
> byte-identical on all four carriers**, and `_mrt.fmt`'s eight legal encodings with **104 of
> 256 values silently zeroing**.
>
> **The sharpening: across all 256 `rt_index` values on four carriers in two runs there is NOT A
> SINGLE FAULT.** Absence of a fault proves nothing about whether the read landed. A poisoned
> read-back, never the status code, must be the oracle — the same lesson the `device_store`
> unbound-slot result teaches in a second instruction family.
>
> **Still not emittable, and why.** `tile_read` remains blocked by `b2`, `b4`, `b6_hi`, `b7`,
> `tail`; `tile_read_mrt` by `b4`, `b6_hi`, `tail`. `b2`/`b4`/`b6_hi` never moved on either
> carrier over their full ranges in both runs, but they stay `untested` **as a limit of the
> carriers, not as "the field is inert"** — the dimension a `raw`-typed byte controls is
> unknown. `b7` *moves* (229 of 256) but does **not reproduce** (91.0% cross-run agreement, 23
> disagreeing values), and that instability reproduces `EXP-0164`'s M4 instability, making it a
> property of the field rather than of one machine's weather.

### `n3_mov`: compact half-register move (EXP-0174/0175/0230) — `target: G17P`

Evidence label **`HW-VALIDATED`, generated with zero copied bytes.** This closes the gap
`docs/isa/register-move-and-liveness.md` records an external compiler engineer hitting head-on.

`n3_mov` is a **16-bit half-register move** with independent source-half and destination-half
selection:

- **Exact register reach (EXP-0230):** the source descriptor is `(S << 1) | hs`, but this form
  directly reads only physical **r0..r63**. All 256 descriptor bytes execute; S=64..127 reads
  `r[S mod 64]`, including while r64..r95 hold independently observed different values. The
  destination nibble directly writes **r0..r15**. Thus two half moves prove 32-bit transfers only
  from r0..r63 to r0..r15. They do not provide any transfer involving physical r64..r95, nor a
  low-to-high result move. See `../../APPLE9_REGISTER_STATE.md` and EXP-0230.

- **`iter_at.loc` is bit 1 ALONE — two classes of exactly 128 values.** `bit1 = 0` → **centroid**,
  `bit1 = 1` → **per-sample**; **bit 0 and bits 2..7 are don't-care** (`0x81` behaves exactly as
  `0x01`, `0x83` exactly as `0x03`). This **refines** the enum `{1: centroid, 3: sample}`: the
  enum lists two legal values, the hardware has one selector bit and seven free bits, which is
  strictly more useful to an emitter — it now knows what it may leave alone. `HW-VALIDATED`,
  `target: G17P`, `EXP-0163` §2. Read back at probe pixel (8,8) of a 4-sample resolved target,
  a `centroid_perspective` varying is `3249.99976` for `loc & 2 == 0` and `3312.49976` for
  `loc & 2 != 0`, other channels untouched.

  > **The field has NO EFFECT below 2 samples, and that is why it read inert for a whole wave.**
  > `0 / 256` values move at `rasterSampleCount == 1`; `128 / 256` move at 4. At one sample the
  > centroid, the sample point and the pixel centre are the same point, so no location selector
  > can move anything: the field was structurally unreachable, not inert. **Two carriers
  > identical in the dimension a field controls are one carrier.**
  >
  > *Method bound, corrected by the experiment against its own earlier draft:* the two builds are
  > **not** byte-identical. The vertex stage is (166 B, same sha256); the fragment stage is 174 B
  > at one sample and 482 B at four. This is a controlled comparison of the same source under one
  > changed pipeline parameter, **not** a byte-for-byte splice pair, and a reviewer should read it
  > that way. What is held constant is what the claim rests on: both `loc` values the compiler
  > itself chooses are present on both sides.

- ⛔ **`vary_store.hint6` bit 4 makes the ENTIRE fragment output read 0.0.** Bit 4 alone, two
  classes of 128, measured on **7 arms across 5 carriers** with "exactly the values with bit 4
  set" moving on every one and both runs agreeing. Setting it loses **all four fragment output
  channels — the whole varying block, not just this component.** The compiler's own values
  `0x48`–`0x4d` all have it clear. `HW-VALIDATED`, `target: G17P`, `EXP-0163` §4.

- **`tex_sample.coord` is an operand byte of the form `(reg << 1) | is32`** — the same source-byte
  convention `db.json` already documents for `falu2`, where bit 0 selects the 32-bit operand and
  the upper 7 bits are a register index. `HW-VALIDATED`, `target: G17P`, `EXP-0172` §2.1: 256
  values on each of four arms over two gated runs at **100% per-value cross-run agreement**
  (`EXP-0155` got 73–93% and reported the field unstable; the instability was a rule, not noise).

  > **On the fragment stage the register index ALIASES WITH PERIOD 16** — the live registers recur
  > at `reg`, `reg+16`, … `reg+112`. That is a **smaller period than the mod-64 ALU aliasing**
  > `EXP-0112` HW-validated, and it is why 32 of 256 values move rather than 4. The moving set is
  > reproduced with zero exceptions in both runs by
  > `moved ⟺ (v & 1) == 1 ∧ ((v >> 1) mod 16) ∈ {6, 8, 10, 14}`.
  >
  > **A coordinate pointed at a register the program does not keep live produces a silent
  > unchanged result, never a fault** — the Apple9 silent-failure signature again.
  >
  > *Scope:* filtered, implicit-LOD sampling was **deliberately excluded**. That its
  > derivative/LOD dependence caused `EXP-0155`'s instability is **supported** (the derivative-free
  > carriers are 100% reproducible) but **not demonstrated on a filtered arm**. One arm of four
  > has detection power; the other three move at zero of 256.

- **Four bytes `db.json` declares inert or reserved are LIVE, and none of the effects is small**
  (`HW-VALIDATED`, `target: G17P`, `EXP-0163` §4). Each rule is **form-specific** and must be read
  with its form:
  - **`tex_coord_setup.b6` bits 2, 3, 4, 5 must ALL be clear** — exactly the 16 values with
    `(v & 0x3c) == 0` reproduce the baseline; any of those bits set and the addressed varying
    reads `0.0`.
  - **`tex_coord_setup.idx` bit 7** (on the byte+4 == `0x42` form): clear it and that one varying
    reads `0.0` while the other three are untouched — the byte really is that store's destination
    selector, as `db.json`'s own `dst<<2` note implies. **Inert over all 256 values on the
    byte+4 == `0x00` form.**
  - **`tex_coord_setup.b8` bit 3** (plus bit 4 on two arms): same signature, zeroing exactly the
    one varying the occurrence addresses. Live only on the `0x42` form.
  - **`tex_coord_setup.b5`** bits 0, 1, 2, 4 (+3 on the `0x42` form): bit 0 set → the varying reads
    `0.0`; bit 3 with `b6` clear shifts the varying's **value** slightly (6.08333 → 6.0918 /
    6.10946) — an address/offset perturbation rather than a kill.

- **`simd_shuffle.rsv9` is NOT reserved.** On the `mode == 0x06` rotate / shuffle-and-fill form,
  bits 6 and 7 change the fill **result value** (31 → 116 → 256 across the combinations, bit 2
  giving a further distinct value) and bit 1 suppresses the stores that follow; 240–248 of 256
  values move. **Inert on the `0x00` / `0x04` / `0x05` forms.** `HW-VALIDATED`, `target: G17P`,
  `EXP-0163` §4.
