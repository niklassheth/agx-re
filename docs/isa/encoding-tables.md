# Apple9 (G16G/G17P) AGX — Instruction Encoding Tables

> **Generated** from `tools/agx-isa/db.json` by `tools/agx-isa/gen_encoding_tables.py` (2026-09-04). Regenerate after any DB change; do not hand-edit. This is the **authoritative, self-contained encoding table** a driver author reads to emit Apple9 AGX instructions — 184 instruction descriptors.

**Clean-room:** every encoding here was learned from the compiled form of MSL **we wrote** (OWN-SHADER) — by byte-diffing our own shaders and by splicing bytes and running them on the real Apple9 GPUs (hardware validation). No Apple binary was disassembled. See `../../CLAUDE.md`.

## How to read this

- Bit numbering: an *N*-byte instruction is one **little-endian** integer. Bit 0 = bit 0 of byte 0; bit 16 = bit 0 of byte +2; so *byte offset +k, bit b* = bit (8·k + b).
- **Length** is a function of byte 0 (the group) plus a per-group length bit/signature — the first parcel does *not* encode length on Apple9. The full length rule is the byte-0 table in the [Length rule](#length-rule-byte-0) appendix and `tools/agx-isa/isadb.py::instr_length`.
- **Match** = the constant bits that identify the instruction. **Fields** = every non-constant bit, with its bit-range, type, and enum values where known.
- Field **type**: `register` · `immediate` · `enum` · `modifier` · `opcode-select` · `raw/unmapped` (byte-diff-localized but not individually bit-decoded).

## Float ALU

### `falu2` — 2-source float ALU (fadd/fmul), reg-reg

*d = op(srcA, [-]srcB); compact two-source float ALU. The GPR fields are scattered: dst = dst | (dst_mid<<4) | (dst_hi<<6), srcA = srcA_reg | (srcA_hi<<6), and in GPR mode srcB = srcB_reg | (srcB_hi<<6). This r0..r95 map is hardware-validated on T8132 by EXP-M4-38 and matches the independently proven Apple9 FMA, integer-logic, and ISELECT register-bank architecture. srcA_aux/srcB_aux are descriptor auxiliaries, not GPR high bits; srcB_aux remains live in the non-GPR inline-source encoding. opflags bit19/20 release sources A/B and bit21 publishes the destination. srcB_imm bit39 and srcB_file bit41 select the non-GPR/inline overload; in that mode the descriptor can encode the measured 8-bit minifloat family, while srcB_hi is a GPR high bit only in GPR mode. srcB_neg bit43 negates source B. scoreboard_slot bits45..47 select the pending-result scoreboard slot. Metal normally allocates slots 6,1,2,3,4,5.*

### `falu2i` — 2-source float ALU, srcB packed minifloat immediate

- **Length:** 6 bytes  ·  **Match:** bits[0:4]==0x9, bits[39:40]==0x1  ·  **Provenance:** HW-validated

*d = op(srcA, K)  ; srcB is the packed non-IEEE float immediate K = imm_decode(b1, sign). exp(bits12:16,bias11) mant(bits9:12) flag(bit8) sign(bit19). Range +-{0,1/32..30}. HW-VALIDATED EXP-0006.  [CORRECTED 2026-08-28] srcA_reg is 6 BITS with an inert top bit -- see falu2's corrected note; the refutation was independently reproduced on falu2i by construction (EXP-0105). Bits 45..47 are a numeric pending-result selector: 0 is the ordinary/materialized path and 1..6 name producer slots 1..6. The old observation that load-sourced operands require byte+5 high bits 0xC0 is therefore the native slot-6 encoding, not an indivisible modifier pair. Selector 7 remains unresolved and must not be emitted.*

### `falu2_uni` — 2-source float ALU, srcB UNIFORM-register source (a + uniform)

- **Length:** 6 bytes  ·  **Match:** bits[0:4]==0x9, bits[39:40]==0x1, bits[15:16]==0x0  ·  **Provenance:** mixed

*d = op(srcA_gpr, uniform_reg[usrc>>1])  ; srcB is a UNIFORM (thread-invariant) register, not a GPR and not an immediate. Selected when bit39=1 AND byte+1's exponent nibble < 8 (bit15=0); the minifloat immediate (falu2i) uses exp>=8 (bit15=1). uniform index = byte+1 = (ureg<<1)|size32. The uniform value is preloaded by the driver / the constant (uniform) program (EXP-0010/EXP-0020). RT-1a-FIX HW-VALIDATED. FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `uni_mode` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1).*

### `falu3` — 3-source float ALU (fma)

- **Length:** 8 bytes  ·  **Match:** bits[0:4]==0x9, bits[17:18]==0x1  ·  **Provenance:** HW-validated

| `srcmods` | [56:64] (byte+7) | modifier |  |

*d = +/-(a*b) + c ; three-source float ALU (fma). srcA=byte+3, srcB=byte+4, srcC=byte+5. The 16-bit tail is the float-ALU source-modifier/cache region (same family as the HW-validated falu3_srcmod12 ext_srcmod): ctrl (byte+6, cache/round; usually 0x02) and srcmods (byte+7): default 0xc0, bit3 (0x08) = negate the a*b product -- OWN-MSL byte-diff located (fma with -a or -b flips byte+7 0xc0->0xc8). Remaining srcmods bits (abs promotes to the 12B falu3_srcmod12 form) need splice for the full map. FIELD NAMES ARE MISLEADING (EXP-0138, confirmed): byte0 high nibble is the DESTINATION; byte+1/+3/+5 are the sources; byte+4 is the length-selecting control byte. The 28 apparent 'misses' are exactly bit0-clear descriptors -- a 16-bit read of an f32 register -- which CONFIRMS the `(reg<<1)|is32` encoding rather than contradicting it. Same applies to `falu3_ext`. OPERAND-SLOT RENAME (EXP-0138, HW-VALIDATED, 1809 + 2321 cases): the former names `dst_lo`/`dst`/`srcA`/`srcB`/`srcC` were wrong. byte0's high nibble is the whole DESTINATION (`dst`, 14/16 exact); byte+1 is the FIRST source descriptor (`srcA`, 228/256); byte+3 is the SECOND source (`srcB`, 228/256); byte+5 is the THIRD source (`srcC`, 252/256); byte+4 is a CONTROL byte (`ctrl_len`) whose low 2 bits re-length the instruction (192/256). The 28 `srcA`/`srcB` misses are exactly the descriptor values with bit0 CLEAR: bit0 is the operand SIZE bit (1 = 32-bit, 0 = 16-bit) and a 16-bit read of an f32-seeded register returns 0.0 -- which CONFIRMS (reg<<1)|is32. byte+5's bit0 does NOT behave as a size bit. BYTE+2 IS TWO FIELDS (EXP-0160 DEF-0160-1, HW, G17P; re-derived in EXP-0165): opsel = bits 16-18, opflags = bits 19-23, exactly falu2's layout -- see the `op` field note for the measured operation map, the srcB release flag, the two silent corruptors and the single inert bit. An emitter treating byte+2 as one opaque opcode cannot set the release/publication flag, which is what makes a register reusable. [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] DENORMAL BEHAVIOUR, OBS-0201-1 (EXP-0201, G17P): a denormal operand and/or a denormal RESULT does not survive this fused multiply-add. 1.4e-45 * 2.0 + 0.0, whose IEEE result is 0x00000002, returned 0x00000000. The two flush points (input flush vs output flush) are NOT separated by this arm. Found by the bit-exact offline classifier; the sweep's own tolerance-based comparison accepted it as correct. Evidence: analysis/op_semantics.json.*

### `funary` — float source-modifier move (fmov/fabs/fneg)

- **Length:** 10 bytes  ·  **Match:** byte+0==0x0b, byte+2==0x0e  ·  **Provenance:** HW-validated

| Field | Bits | Type | Enum / values |
|---|---|---|---|

| `ext` | [48:80] (byte+6) | raw/unmapped |  |

*d = mod(a)   ; float source-modifier move. byte+5 selects the modifier: 0x00 = mov (copy), 0x02 = fabs (|a|), 0x0a = fneg (-a). (bit1 = abs-enable, bit3 = negate; negate requires bit1 set -- byte+5=0x08 alone acts as mov.) FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `op` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1).*

### `half_alu` — native fp16 (half) ALU (hadd/hmul); half2 packs 2 lanes

- **Length:** 6 bytes  ·  **Match:** bits[0:4]==0x0  ·  **Provenance:** HW-validated

| Field | Bits | Type | Enum / values |

| `srcA_neg` | [43:44] | modifier |  |
| `dst_hi` | [44:45] | register |  |
| `scoreboard_slot` | [45:48] | modifier |  |

*d.half = op(srcA.half, srcB.half), with opsel 4=hadd and 5=hmul. srcA_half/srcB_half choose the low or high 16-bit lane; the physical GPRs use the common Apple9 split map: dst = dst | (dst_mid<<4) | (dst_hi<<6), srcA = srcA_reg | (srcA_hi<<6), and in GPR mode srcB = srcB_reg | (srcB_hi<<6). EXP-M4-38 validates this map on T8132, including exact low-half results and preservation of the unselected high half. srcA_aux/srcB_aux are descriptor auxiliaries. opflags carries source lifetime/publication state, ctrl selects compact versus longer forms, and srcA_neg negates source A. The scoreboard-slot position is inherited from the shared compact-ALU skeleton and was not independently swept for half ALU.*

### `falu_acc` — compact 4-byte float accumulate (reduction)

- **Length:** 4 bytes  ·  **Match:** bits[0:4]==0x9, bits[17:21]==0xc, bits[22:24]==0x0  ·  **Provenance:** HW-validated

*d = srcA (+) srcB  ; COMPACT 4-byte float accumulate (float-ALU group low-nibble 9, byte+2 in {0x18,0x38} = opsel with the arithmetic-enable bit clear vs the 6-byte 0x3c fadd). Omits the byte+4/+5 modifier tail of the 6-byte falu2, so the compiler emits it for plain reduction accumulates. byte+3 = srcB register descriptor. byte+2 bit5 (`cache`: 0x18 vs 0x38) is a source-cache/last-use hint, NOT an op change (RT-1a-FIX: splice 0x18<->0x38 leaves the reduction result unchanged).*

### `cvt_f2h` — fp32 -> fp16 narrowing convert

- **Length:** 6 bytes  ·  **Match:** byte+0==0x11  ·  **Provenance:** HW-validated

| Field | Bits | Type | Enum / values |
|---|---|---|---|

| `tail` | [40:48] (byte+5) | raw/unmapped |  |

*d(half) = half(a)  ; fp32 -> fp16 narrowing convert. byte0 0x11 is length-polymorphic on byte+1: byte+1 == 0x03 = this 6-byte convert; byte+1 in {0x02,0x04} = the 8/10-byte NATIVE bfloat ALU (bf_alu) below. The reverse (fp16->fp32) is the ordinary falu2 with a 16-bit srcA (byte1 bit0 = 0) -- reuses the size bit.  [EXP-0217] MATCH OVER-FIT, MEASURED (EXP-0216, from EXP-0144's committed M4/G16G raw -- **G16G-direct, NOT promoted to G17P**). This descriptor spends all eight bits of byte0 on `match`, and **6 550 of the 6 555 committed encodings keyed to it FAIL that match**. The ONLY failing constraint is byte0, and its LOW nibble -- the opcode group -- holds on 6 515 of the 6 555; the dominant observed byte0 is 0x01 (6 440 records), i.e. the same convert with dst = r0. The high nibble is a DESTINATION REGISTER in every dst-parameterised sibling in this database (cvt_f2h_dst, cvt_bf16, bf_add_dst, bf_fma_dst all pin only [0,4,1]), so this is the DEF-0171-1 dst-nibble over-fit: **the descriptor is pinned to destination register r1.** EXP-0144's own byte0 sweep demonstrates it rather than inferring it: the carrier `c_f2h` anchor 010114810402 is `ok` with word0 = 15872 (0x3E00, the packed half), 110114810402 is `wrong_value` (the half is no longer in that slot), a10114810402 is `wrong_value` with the half MOVED to word2, and ff0114810402 is a silent zero. 5 315 of the 6 555 satisfy `cvt_f2h_dst` instead. NOT REPAIRED HERE, and why: narrowing this match to [[0,4,1]] and adding `dst` (4,4) makes cvt_f2h a 4-match-bit near-duplicate of the 8-match-bit cvt_f2h_dst, i.e. a catch-all for the whole length-6 low-nibble-1 group. EXP-0217 built and measured that variant against the 1 080-file own-MSL corpus and REFUSED it as a measured regression -- see experiments/EXP-0217-descriptor-application/RESULTS.md and work/var_m1. The four field rows b1/src/b4/tail need no move regardless: their spans are byte-for-byte cvt_f2h_dst's srcfmt/src/dhalf/tail. One row is NOT freely re-pointable even so -- `cvt_f2h.src` sweeps byte+3 and cvt_f2h_dst pins (28,4) == 8, so 1 200 of its 1 280 records fall OUTSIDE the sibling's match.*

### `bf_alu` — native bfloat (brain-float16) general ALU (add/mul/fma)

*d(bfloat) = op(a,b)  ; NATIVE bfloat (brain-float16) general ALU. byte0 0x11 is a DISTINCT group -- the bfloat sibling of the 0x10 native-fp16 ALU group and the 0x11 fp32->fp16 convert group -- reusing the SAME opsel byte+2 (0x1c add / 0x1d mul / 0x1e fma, the 10-byte form) as the 0x10/0x09 float groups. NOT lowered to fp32 (a single 0x11 op does the add; no widen-add-narrow sequence) and NOT the 0x10 fp16 group (byte0 differs). byte+1 = 0x02 scalar bfloat, 0x04 bfloat2 (each packed lane a separate 0x11 op). bfloat carries fp32 range (bf16 = top 16 bits of fp32), so bfloat->float is a free 0x03 widen and float->bfloat is a 0x11 byte+1==0x03 rounding convert. This descriptor names the 8-byte scalar (byte+1==0x02) add/mul; the bfloat2-packed (byte+1==0x04) and 10-byte fma (opsel 0x1e) forms tokenize by the length rule but are not separately named. ⚠ G17P's OWN NATIVE BFLOAT ALU DOES NOT TOKENIZE -- DEF-0171-2 (EXP-0171; re-derived in EXP-0175). Our own bfloat add / mul / fma compile on G17P to `31 00 1c 00 11 00 c0 81` (8B), `31 00 1d 00 11 00 c0 81` (8B) and `31 00 1e 00 86 02 10 00 c0 81` (10B). All three raise `unknown instruction length (byte0=0x31)`. The blocker is the LENGTH RULE in isadb.py, NOT this descriptor set: the low-nibble-1 bfloat branch is gated on byte+1 in {0x02,0x04} and G17P emits byte+1 == 0x00. Given a length, these bytes are already claimed correctly and unambiguously -- bf_add_dst / bf_mul_dst / bf_fma_dst each match them with 12 match bits against bf_alu8_var's 4. The length rule is the length-rule owner's file and is REPORTED, NOT PATCHED here. Separately, `bf_alu`'s match demands byte0 == 0x11 -- a full 8-bit byte0, the same dst-nibble over-fit as DEF-0171-1 (0x31 is dst r3, 0x11 is dst r1) -- and byte+1 == 0x02, which G17P does not emit; the dst-parameterised siblings cover the general case, so that match is left alone rather than widened blind.  [EXP-0217] THE MATCH OVER-FIT ABOVE IS NOW COUNTED (EXP-0216, from EXP-0171's committed G17P raw). Of the **13 144** committed 8-byte encodings keyed to `bf_alu`, **ZERO satisfy this descriptor's match.** Both constraints fail, and they fail differently: bits[8:+8] want 2 got 0 on **all 13 144** (G17P emits byte+1 == 0x00, so the byte-1 constant is one this target never produces), and bits[0:+8] want 17 got 49 on **12 626** (byte0 = 0x31 = dst r3, group 1 -- the dst-nibble over-fit, DEF-0171-1). The dst-parameterised siblings claim the same bytes correctly: 7 972 satisfy bf_add_dst and 2 652 satisfy bf_mul_dst. NO FIELD ROW MOVES, and none needs to: per SWEPT BYTE the three descriptors assign IDENTICAL spans -- byte+3 is `srcA` (24,8) in all three, byte+4 is `srcB` (32,8) in all three, bytes +5..+7 are `tail` (40,24) in all three. (The contrary impression came from summing field counts across bytes 3..7 at once.) If this descriptor is ever widened or retired, the edit is to byte 0 and byte 1 ONLY. EXP-0217 built and measured the byte-0/byte-1 widening (match -> [[0,4,1]]) against the own-MSL corpus and did not take it; see experiments/EXP-0217-descriptor-application/RESULTS.md and work/var_m2.*

*d[dst] = SFU(src). Function = (byte0 bit7 `fn_hi`, byte+1-lo `fnclass`). OPERAND BYTES CORRECTED ON HARDWARE -- EXP-0161 (G17P), re-derived independently in EXP-0165 (db_defects :: DEF-0161-1). The pre-2026-08-30 descriptor had the DESTINATION and the SOURCE in the wrong bytes, which an emitter could not detect: the program runs, faults nothing, and writes the wrong register. The measured model is: **byte+3 is the DESTINATION register**, packed `reg = v >> 1` (bit 0 is HW-tested don't-care on the f32 datapath and is NOT the project-standard is32 bit -- the compiler's own f32 rsqrt encodes byte+3 = 0x00); **byte+5 is the SOURCE register**, packed `reg = v >> 2` (bits 0-1 HW-tested don't-care); and **bits12..17 are a six-bit pending-result dependency mask** -- bit12 names slot1 through bit17 naming slot6, and multiple bits request the union (EXP-M4-42). The earlier low-pressure-inert interpretation of byte+1's high nibble and EXP-M4-41's initial boolean 0x54/0x56 handoff interpretation are superseded. EVIDENCE: 16-register architectural dumps -- sweeping byte+5 moves which register is READ (it is released to zero) in blocks of 4 and the computed rsqrt matches that register's seed exactly (60/60 fit, 0 misfits, both runs); sweeping byte+3 moves which register RECEIVES the result in blocks of 2 (28/28 fit, 0 misfits, both runs); an exact-mask search over all 256 masks returns exactly `(v & 0xFE) == 0` for byte+3 and `(v & 0xFC) == 0` for byte+5, i.e. exactly the free bits the model predicts. GENERATED: 20/20 `r_i = rsqrt(r_j)` encodings for arbitrary i,j -- encodings the compiler never emitted -- predicted host-side and executed correctly (the old model scores 10 fail + 10 unpredictable on the same 20). This also EXPLAINS rather than contradicts EXP-0138's byte+3 report ('only 2 and 3 give the correct rsqrt; 188 values silently return 0.0; 6 and 7 leave the poison intact'): that is exactly what a DESTINATION selector does in a carrier whose store reads r1. REGISTER RANGE / DO-NOT-EMIT REGION: byte+3 = v gives destination r[v>>1], so v = 0..191 reaches r0..r95 -- the whole 96-GPR file -- and v = 192..255 would name r96..r127, which do not exist. Every one of those 64 values HANGS or FAULTS the command buffer (EXP-0161 danger arm: 45 of 64 gave a genuine kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorHang, 19 were only ever observed as innocent victims of their neighbours' resets, 0 ever worked; EXP-0138 independently recorded 60 faults plus three watchdog hangs at 192/193/194 on M4). An emitter must never encode a destination register >= 96 here. The safe region 0..191 is dense and clean in three EXP-0161 carriers; EXP-0237 additionally executes all 192 safe values with register-specific exact results in two quiet generated direct-round runs, and shows bit 0 aliases in that envelope. SOURCE RANGE: byte+5 = v gives source r[v>>2], so the exhausted field reaches r0..r63 only and cannot represent physical r64..r95. EXP-0237 executes all 256 source-byte values in two quiet generated direct-round runs, identifies each source arithmetically, and shows bits 0-1 alias in that envelope. Source release is controlled independently by byte+6 bit 4 (EXP-M4-41). FUNCTION SELECT (measured BY COMPUTED VALUE on G17P, EXP-0161 + EXP-0165 re-derivation, db_defects :: DEF-0161-3 as corrected): on the standard-SFU datapath (byte+6/+7 = 0xb0/0x40) `fnclass` bit 3 is a DON'T-CARE -- v and v+8 are identical in every one of the 8 pairs, in three carriers -- but bit 2 is NOT a blanket don't-care, which is where EXP-0161's own summary over-generalised. Measured map: with fn_hi=1 (byte0 0xaf): class&3 = 1 -> rsqrt, 2 -> exp2, 3 -> rsqrt (same as 1), 0 -> returns +inf for every input; and bit 2 is inert for class&3 in {1,2,3} but live at class&3 = 0 (classes 4/12 store nothing at all). With fn_hi=0 (byte0 0x2f): class&3 = 0 -> rint, 1 -> rsqrt, 2 -> log2, 3 -> a primitive that returns NaN for 11 of 12 positive-finite inputs (consistent with the sincos/tan range-reduction primitive this enum has always named, not proof of it); and bit 2 is live at class&3 in {0,1} (class 4/12 store nothing; class 5/13 FAULT the command buffer) and inert at {2,3}. So the pre-existing `fn_hi` enum is now HW-CONFIRMED ON G17P BY COMPUTED VALUE at class 2 (0 -> log2, 1 -> exp2), and the `fnclass` enum's 0/1/2/3 rows are confirmed for the DIRECT (0x2f) family. Note that on this datapath class 0 does NOT compute rcp -- rcp needs fnsel 0x10. ROUND MODE / NaN BIT (db_defects :: DEF-0161-4, HW, G17P): on the rsqrt (0xaf) and log2 (0x2f) SFU datapaths byte+8 has exactly ONE live bit, bit 0, and setting it returns NaN in ALL 12 output lanes for EVERY input -- 128 of 256 values, in two carriers x two gated runs, 128/128 each time -- while all 128 even values reproduce the correct result bit-for-bit. **An emitter must never set byte+8 bit 0.** The round-mode enum below (0 nearest / 2 floor / 4 ceil / 6 trunc) is a claim about the DIRECT ROUND family only. EXP-0237 re-tests value 2 as floor by exact computed value over 912 positive direct-round cases; the relative 0/4/6 map remains untested in that carrier. On the two earlier rsqrt/log2 SFU datapaths, values 2/4/6 are indistinguishable from 0. OTHER FIELDS, accept-rules measured densely over all 256 values (G17P, the accepted set is the set that reproduces the unmutated result): bits12..17 form the pending dependency mask; byte+2 0x54/0x55/0x56/0x57 therefore mean no dependency/slot5/slot6/slots5+6, while byte+2 high six bits retain operand-mode value 0x15; `src_class` byte+4 (v & 0x02) == 0x02, one live bit, clearing it silently zeroes; `fnsel` byte+6 (v & 0x99) == 0x90, 16 of 256, identical in all three carriers; `precsel` byte+7 (v & 0x64) == 0x40 (32 of 256) in the natural carriers, looser ((v & 0x60) == 0x40) in the synthesized one; `sched_flag` byte+9 HW-TESTED INERT over all 256 values in both carriers. The op itself: one hardware special-function op; fast-math emits it directly (~1 ULP). exp/exp10 = exp2(x*k); log/log10 = log2(x)*k; pow = exp2(b*log2(a)); a/b = a*rcp(b). `emit_unsafe` is RETAINED, but its meaning has changed: the descriptor geometry is no longer wrong (EXP-0165 fixed it) -- the flag now marks the two documented do-not-emit regions, byte+3 >= 192 and byte+8 bit 0.*

Appears ONLY in the precise (non-fast-math) reciprocal/root lowerings; fast-math uses the single-op SFU (fspecial 0xaf/0x2f) instead. SUBOP 0x0F OBSERVED AND ENCODABLE (DEF-0171-5, EXP-0171 G17P; re-derived in EXP-0175): our own precise `rsqrt` lowers on G17P to `09 83 25 0f 00 c2`, i.e. byte+3 == 0x0f, a value the pre-2026-08-30 enum did not list. The descriptor's own match ([24,1,1] and [27,1,1] and [28,4,0]) leaves exactly two free bits, so the legal subop set is {0x09, 0x0b, 0x0d, 0x0f} -- 0x0f is not an anomaly, it is the fourth member. WHAT 0x0f COMPUTES IS NOT ESTABLISHED: EXP-0171's accept-set for this field is the singleton {0x0f}, which shows every other value breaks that carrier, not that a sub-op map was measured. RANGE CAVEAT for label auditors: validation.json records `256 of 256 sub-values` for this field, but only 4 of those 256 byte values are legal encodings of this instruction.*

*d = srcA + srcB (addsub=1, byte0 0x9f) | d = srcA - srcB (addsub=0, byte0 0x1f)  ; integer 2-source add/sub. byte0 bit7 (addsub) is the ADD/SUBTRACT selector: the compiler emits 0x9f for + and 0x1f for -, and splicing a real add's byte0 0x9f->0x1f turns 10+20 into 10-20=-10 on hardware (RT-1a-FIX -- corrects the earlier INVERTED `srcA_neg`/semantics). dst=b3 (reg<<1)|size, a full 8-bit byte -> 7-bit reg (r0..r127), so unlike the 6-byte falu2's 4-bit dst nibble the integer dst reaches the whole GPR file (up to 96 regs, EXP-0020). srcB may be an 8-bit inline immediate K in [0,255] encoded as (K<<1) at b5:b6bit0 (NOT a minifloat -- EXP-0007). A source may name a UNIFORM register: uniform srcB sets byte+5 bit4 (0x10), uniform srcA sets byte+6 (0x30) -- HW byte-diff EXP-0020. EXP-M4-13 R6 (own-MSL byte-diff): signed and unsigned add/sub are BYTE-IDENTICAL (the 10-byte 2-src add is sign-agnostic; there is no separate sign field). The srcB immediate is a 9-bit field (srcB_imm b5[0:8] + srcB_imm_hi b6bit0) stored (K<<1): addi{1,5,7,255}->b5=0x02/0x0a/0x0e/0xfe, b6bit0=1 at 255. The former reading of byte+1 high bits as part of a scattered srcB register number is superseded: only residual bits9..11 retain the historical srcB_reg_hi name, while bits12..17 are the pending dependency mask; the srcB-is-register-vs-immediate TYPE flips opc_tail/opc_tail2 (b8 bit1, b9 bit0) and srcA b7 bit5 -- reg-srcB tail = a8 17 05, imm-srcB tail = 88 15 04. DESTINATION BOUNDS (EXP-0139 DEF-0139-4 + EXP-0146, HW): EXP-0112's r(R mod 64) register-ALIASING rule does NOT transfer to this field -- at dst=140/141 (register 70, which would alias r6) the sum did not appear in r6. The fault boundary is also much lower here: dst byte 0xBE..0xFF (register index >= 95) raises a contained GPU ADDRESS FAULT, reproducibly over 60..66 dense values (5/5 attempts each, healthy baselines). Independently corroborates EXP-0020's ~96-entry GPR file from a different family and method. Emitter bound for this form: destination register <= 94. NATIVE 64-BIT ADD EXISTS (EXP-0146, HW-VALIDATED): the claim that '64-bit SUB uses the single native 0x1f op' while 64-bit ADD needs the iadd2 -> carry_gen -> psel -> high-add chain is only a statement about what the Apple compiler emits. Flipping ONLY the addsub bit of the 64-bit subtract (byte0 0x1f -> 0x9f) yields an EXACT single-instruction 64-bit ADD, verified on two independent 8-row boundary input sets (including 2^64-1 + 1 = 0 and 2^63 + 2^63 = 0), in both gated runs and 5/5 repetitions. A native 64-bit register-pair ADD exists and is emittable. ⚠ OPERAND MODEL CORRECTED (EXP-0154, HW-VALIDATED on G17P, 248/248): **`srcB_ext` is the srcA REGISTER SELECTOR in `reg<<2` packing — it is NOT a modifier.** The full model is `d = r[srcB_ext>>2] + r[srcB_imm>>2]`, matching 128/128 across a dense 7-bit sweep for all 16 observable registers r0..r15, with every value selecting an unseeded register (>=r16) reading 0 exactly as predicted (128/128). Re-verified independently by the orchestrator from the raw register dumps. **This SUPERSEDES EXP-0128/EXP-0139's 'srcA always reads r0'** — it read r0 only because `srcB_ext` happened to be 0 in every compiler-emitted anchor. Consequences for an emitter: db.json types `srcB_ext` as `mod`, which is wrong; and the field currently named `srcA` (byte+7 = 0xa8) is therefore NOT the srcA register selector. **Do NOT adopt EXP-0146's carrier-scoped `(v & 0x7C) == 0x00` rule** — it fits that carrier's ok-set only because it encodes 'srcA must be r0', and shipped as a modifier constraint it would tell an emitter that bits 2..6 must be zero when those bits are how you CHOOSE THE REGISTER. The field is not width-dependent.*

*d = m * (srcA * srcB) + A  ; integer multiply-add. **OPERAND MODEL CORRECTED ON HARDWARE** -- EXP-0160 (G17P), re-derived independently in EXP-0165 (db_defects :: DEF-0160-3, DEF-0160-6, DEF-0160-7). The pre-2026-08-30 descriptor modelled NO first-multiplicand register at all and documented byte+6 as `srcC_lo`, the low byte of an immediate addend that does not exist. An implementer following it could not choose the first operand of an integer multiply. **byte+6 (this descriptor's `srcB`) is a MULTIPLICAND REGISTER SELECTOR: reg = v >> 3.** Bit 0 = 1 makes that source read 0; bits 1 and 2 are inert. Measured over the 2-D (byte+7 x byte+6) probe, 132 points x 2 seed sets, by solving r0 = m*(seed[a]*seed[b]) + A for BOTH multiplicand registers left free and requiring one solution to satisfy both seed sets at once: byte+6 = 0x10 pins the multiplicand to r2 UNIQUELY, and 0x00/0x02/0x04 -> r0, 0x08 -> r1, 0x20 -> r4, 0x40 -> r8 all contain the predicted register; 0x01/0x03 read 0 and 0x7F names r15 (seed 0). The rule fits 10 of the 11 probed values; the eleventh (0xFF -> r31) is outside the 16 seeded registers and is unmeasurable, not a counterexample. **byte+7 (`srcC_desc`) is a 2-bit MODE plus a 5-bit ADDEND-SOURCE SELECT, and the addend is NOT in the instruction.** Measured over the dense 256-value byte+7 sweep x 2 seed sets: 191 of the 192 non-fault values with a clean two-seed observation fit r0 = m*(srcA*srcB) + A EXACTLY (the single exception is a dispatch that returned status OK having written nothing -- DEF-0160-5). m is determined ENTIRELY by bits 0-1: 0 -> keep the product, 1 -> drop it, 2 -> drop it, 3 -> REPRODUCIBLE FAULT (all 64 values with (v & 3) == 3 fault and no other value does). Bit 2 is INERT (zero disagreeing pairs over the whole sweep). A is single-valued per K = (v >> 3) & 0x1F across all 32 K, and is SEED-INDEPENDENT by construction of the fit -- so K selects an addend held OUTSIDE the instruction (a uniform/constant slot), it does not encode one. The recovered A values are the carrier's OWN constants' 16-bit halves: K=0 -> 0xC500, K=1 -> 1, K=2 -> 256, K=12 -> 1, K=13 -> 16256 (0x3F80, the high half of 1.0000001f = 0x3F800001), K=14 -> 49045 (0xBF95) and K=15 -> 46038 (0xB3D6) (the two halves of -1e-7f = 0xB3D6BF95); K in {3..11, 16..31} read 0. **An emitter that reads db.json's old '(K<<3) = immediate addend' and emits it gets an imad that adds whatever happens to occupy slot K.** **byte+8 (`mulsel`) does not participate in the addend** (DEF-0160-7): over the 2-D (byte+7 x byte+8) probe the recovered A is constant across every mulsel point, for all 12 byte+7 values. Its documented hi/lo multiply role (0xd0 = low 32 bits, 0xe0 = high 32) is unaffected. NAME PERMUTATION, and why: the multiplicand selector at byte+6 is given the name `srcB` (accurate -- it names a real multiplicand) and byte+5 inherits the historical name `srcC_lo`. **byte+5's role is UNRESOLVED and was never swept.** In the EXP-0160 anchor byte+5 = 0x08 and the second multiplicand is demonstrably r2, which the project-standard (reg<<1)|size packing would read as r4 -- so either byte+5 uses a different packing (reg<<2 fits) or the second multiplicand is selected elsewhere. Do not emit byte+5 from a register number until that is settled. Retained from EXP-M4-13 R6 (own-MSL byte-diff): LOW-32 mul is sign-agnostic (a*b int == uint byte-identical); mad int == uint byte-identical; MULHI is sign-dependent (signed mulhi flips b10 0x0a -> 0x1e); dst = byte+3, (reg<<1)|size, proven by an r6/r4/r2 dst sweep.  [EXP-0217] OPERAND MODEL, THIRD CORRECTION (EXP-0216, desk re-analysis of EXP-0154's committed G17P raw; NO new dispatch). **BOTH byte+5 and byte+6 are multiplicand register selectors, and this descriptor has no field named `srcA`** -- so the semantics line `d = m * (srcA * srcB) + A` above names an operand the field table does not contain. byte+5: reg = v >> 2 (host oracle 64/64 in-domain, both addend models 0/64). byte+6: reg = v >> 3 (68/128 in-domain, the other 60 bit0-killed, addend model 0/128). **EXP-0165's byte+5<->byte+6 swap therefore fixed nothing: it moved the wrong name `srcC_lo` from byte+6 to byte+5 rather than removing it.** WHICH multiplicand is A and which is B is UNDECIDABLE from this carrier -- multiply commutes and EXP-0154 has no non-commutative probe -- so neither byte is named `srcA` here and the `B` in `srcB` carries no ordering claim. WHERE THE ADDEND ACTUALLY LIVES IS STILL OPEN, and byte+7/byte+8 are the two bytes that move it: byte+7 shifts the destination by {0, 1, 256, 16256, 46038, 49045} above an UNCHANGED product of 340 (none of them a GPR seed), and byte+8 gates the addend between 1 (12 of 256 values, all with low nibble 0) and 0 (240 of 256; 4 values give a non-integer result). SUCCESSOR NEEDED for (a) A-vs-B via a non-commutative op or a differing-width probe and (b) the addend's real location. PROPOSED-AND-REFUSED HERE: renaming byte+5 to a multiplicand name. EXP-0216 proposes it; EXP-0217 refuses it, because any name placed opposite `srcB` re-asserts the A/B ordering the same experiment calls undecidable, and because a rename carries this row's `hardware-run` label onto a new name (the DEF-0166-2 / tex_write.rsv10 hazard). The correction is in the field notes instead. Both statements are correct and neither supersedes the other: they describe imad's TWO ADDEND MODES, selected by byte+9 bit 3, and the two anchors the corpus was built from differ in exactly that bit (C-M4 byte+9 = 0x26 -> immediate; C-G17P byte+9 = 0x2e -> external fetch; the anchors differ at byte+7 and byte+9 and nowhere else). Suggested single sentence: 'd = m*(X*Y) + A, X = reg(byte+5 >> 2), Y = reg(byte+6 >> 3); A is an 8-bit immediate byte+7[3:8] | byte+8[0:3]<<5 when byte+9 bit 3 == 0, and is fetched from an external scalar file indexed by that same field when byte+9 bit 3 == 1 (byte+9 bit 0 selects a 16-bit half or a 32-bit word).' EXP-M4-13's '(K<<3) is an immediate' should be recorded as CORRECT IN ITS MODE with the width corrected from 9 bits to 8; DEF-0160-3's 'the addend is not in the instruction' should be recorded as CORRECT IN ITS MODE. Retracting either would lose a real hardware fact.*

*d = min/max(srcA, srcB) with sel 0=fmax, 1=fmin, 4=umax, 5=umin, 6=imax, 7=imin. The operands use the common compact Apple9 split map: dst = dst | (dst_mid<<4) | (dst_hi<<6), srcA = srcA_reg | (srcA_hi<<6), and in GPR mode srcB = srcB_reg | (srcB_hi<<6). EXP-M4-38 validates every register bit on T8132. srcA_aux/srcB_aux are descriptor auxiliaries, not register high bits. fmt holds the source release/destination publication state; srcB_file and src_modifier retain unresolved source-mode controls. The scoreboard-slot position is inherited from the shared compact-ALU skeleton and was not independently swept for min/max.*

OPERAND BLOB SPLIT (EXP-0139 DEF-0139-1, HW): the former 40-bit `operand` raw field is NOT one field.

CORRECTION: byte+4 is an op-ENABLE gate (op_enable), NOT the sub-op selector -- splicing byte+4 0x02->0x03 KEEPS popcount [4,1,16,2] (only bit1 matters: 0x02/0x03/0x06/0x07/0x0a compute, 0x00/0x01/0x04/0x05 -> result 0); this corrects the former "optype 0x02 popcount vs 0x03 find_msb" label (correlation, not causation). bits12..17 form the pending dependency mask: 0x54 has no dependency, 0x55 names slot5, 0x56 names slot6, and 0x57 names both slots5+6 (EXP-M4-42). dst (byte+3) = destination reg (reg<<1, r0=0x00): sweeping to 0x02/04/06/08 breaks delivery ([0,0,0,0]). src (byte+5) = source reg (reg<<2, r0=0x00): non-zero points at an empty register -> popcount(0)=0. srcdesc (byte+6) = source operand descriptor: 0x00 degenerates the op to identity (returns the raw input, popcount NOT applied), bit6 (0x40) must be set for the GPR source to be read (0x3c/0x9c -> 0; 0x5c/0x4e/0x58 read normally). tail (byte+7, 0x04 marker). TAIL RULE (EXP-0139 DEF-0139-3, HW, dense 0..255 x2 gated launches): only BIT 2 of `tail` is load-bearing -- all 128 values with bit2 set compute the correct popcount, all 128 with bit2 clear return a wrong constant. The former '0x04 marker in every observed instance' was a single-template inference.*

*u64 CARRY-GENERATE. `32 01 35 03 22 81` (6 bytes). An unsigned-overflow compare in the integer compare / min-max family (byte0 0x32 = 0x02|0x30; byte+2==0x35 marker; byte+4==0x22 ordered-compare mode) detecting the carry-OUT of the immediately-preceding low-word 32-bit add (sum_lo < operand, unsigned). Its per-lane predicate feeds a following 0x05 psel that materializes the carry as {0,1}, added into the HIGH-word add. The compiler emits this explicit chain for 64-bit ADD; 64-bit SUB uses the single native 0x1f op. Siblings byte0 0x12 (a+const) and 0x22 (intermediate carry of a 3-operand add) share the byte+2==0x35 signature. Operand register bit-packing inferred (byte-diff). TWO-OPERAND COMPARE (EXP-0146, HW): this is `p[dst] = (r[srcA] <u r[srcB])`, not a one-operand marker plus a source. MATCH OVER-CONSTRAINED (EXP-0146, HW, dense 0..255): db.json pins byte+2 to the full byte 0x35, but the hardware only requires (v & 0xCD) == 0x05 -- bits 1, 4 and 5 are DON'T-CARE and 8 of 256 values work {0x05,0x07,0x15,0x17,0x25,0x27,0x35,0x37}. The pre-registered falsifier byte+2 = 0x00 FIRED (contained command-buffer fault), reproducing EXP-0038's A18 neutralisation result on M4 by a second method. Relaxing the match is a DECODE change and is deferred to a corpus A/B. OPERAND PACKING AND SIZE BIT -- HW-VALIDATED (EXP-0161, G17P; independently re-derived in EXP-0165, db_defects :: DEF-0161-7). `srcA` (byte+1) and `srcB` (byte+3) are the project-standard packed operand selector `(reg << 1) | is32` with an INERT bit 7: reg = (v >> 1) & 0x3F -- the released-register map in the synthesized carrier fits 22/22 for srcB -- and **bit 0 is a REAL SIZE BIT**. With it SET the compare is 32-bit; with it CLEAR the hardware compares only the LOW 16 BITS of both operands. Established the hard way: 16 generated encodings built with is32 = 0 while predicting a 32-bit compare failed 9 of 16, and all 16 outcomes are explained exactly by the 16-bit rule; the corrected model then passed 48/48 generated encodings across both widths and both settings of the inert bit 7 (re-scored in EXP-0165 directly from the committed register dumps, 16/16 and 48/48, against 7/16 and 39/48 for an always-32-bit model). An emitter that leaves bit 0 clear gets a silent 16-bit compare. `dst` (byte0 high nibble) selects the predicate register the following psel reads. `cmpmode` (byte+4) accepts (v & 0xA7) == 0x22, 8 of 256; db.json enumerates only 0x22. byte+2 MATCH OVER-CONSTRAINT REPRODUCED ON G17P (EXP-0161; verified in EXP-0165 against every one of the 256 swept values in BOTH carriers and BOTH gated runs): the accepted set is exactly {0x05,0x07,0x15,0x17,0x25,0x27,0x35,0x37} and `(v & 0xCD) == 0x05` is the UNIQUE mask rule that separates it from the 248 rejected values -- an exhaustive search over all 256 candidate masks returns that one and no other. This is a value-for-value G16G -> G17P reproduction of EXP-0146. Relaxing the match is still a DECODE change and is still DEFERRED: expressing (v & 0xCD) == 0x05 in this schema needs three match entries plus two new fields for the freed bits 1 and 4-5, and a new field name cannot be added without editing validation.json in the same commit (tools/agx-isa/validate_labels.py hard-fails on an unlabelled field). EMITTER CAVEAT (EXP-0165, see `length_rule_gaps :: carry_gen_r9_shadow_20260830`): OUR OWN TOKENIZER currently mis-lengths 16 legal `srcA` values here -- byte+1 in {0x00,0x10,0x14,0x19,0x1e,0x20,0x22,0x25,0x28,0x2a,0x51,0x87,0x9d,0xa3,0xa5,0xcb} is claimed by isadb.py's R9 trailing-word closure as a 2-byte pad before the low-nibble-2 length rule is reached. The HARDWARE runs those encodings correctly (6 of EXP-0161's 48 passing generated cases are in that set); it is a defect in our decoder, not in the encoding, and it does not restrict what an emitter may produce.*

*d = rotate_left(a, k)  ; bit-rotate / funnel-shift by an IMMEDIATE amount. Single 12-byte op in the 0x27 family (byte+1==0x01, byte+2==0x56): the 3-operand form fits a funnel shift (hi,lo,shift); for a plain rotate hi==lo==a. Rotate by a REGISTER amount is a multi-instr lowering (0x3b shift-prep + funnel + (32-n) subtract + OR). FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `b1` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1). [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] `operands` WAS NOT ONE FIELD (EXP-0202, G17P). Its five bytes are `rot_dst` (byte+3), `op_enable` (byte+4), `rot_src` (byte+5), the rotate amount (byte+6, still carrying the legacy name `operands`) and `amt_tail` (byte+7). The joint 40-bit arm -- the first this field has ever had -- dispatched 70 values ({0,1,2,max-1,max}, all 40 powers of two, compiled +/-1, and 24 fixed asymmetric interiors) and reproduces at exactly {compiled, compiled+1}, with 11-15 contained faults, 0 hangs, and the abort budget never reached. EXP-0189's `UNSTABLE` refusal does NOT reproduce: 0 of 3212 (arm, value) pairs disagree.*

NOTE: this descriptor is length-selected (every odd-b1 10-byte 0xa7) and so also absorbs the 0xa7 10-byte INTERPOLATION / RT datapath siblings (byte+1==0x81, byte+2==0x22 -- corpus-dominant, 138/188); for those, byte+6/+8/+9 are operand/coefficient words, not a shift amount. Logical >> by immediate uses the 12-byte bitfield-extract form (ibfe); register-operand shifts are multi-instr with a 0x2b prep stage. Per-op-select tail semantics of the non-shift siblings NOT reconstructed (rule 5).*

*bitfield-extract extract_bits(a, off, cnt) (3-operand 12-byte form). Also the lowering for LOGICAL (unsigned) shift-right by an immediate: a>>k = extract_bits(a, k, 32-k). EXP-M4-13 R6 (own-MSL byte-diff): the bitfield OFFSET immediate is offset = b6>>2 (start bit50, PROVEN off 1/3/4/5/6/8 -> b6 0x04/0x0c/0x10/0x14/0x18/0x20); the WIDTH immediate is width = (b10|b11<<8)>>4 (start bit84, PROVEN width 1/4/8/12/16 -> 0x10/0x40/0x80/0xc0/0x100). An unsigned shift-right a>>k lowers to offset=k, width=0 (width=0 => extract-to-MSB / all remaining bits). SIGNED (sign-extending) extract_bits sets sign_ext (b6 bit1) and clears srcC_flags bit0 (b9 0x11->0x10); unsigned zero-extends. dst=b3 (reg<<1)|size PROVEN by a dst sweep (b3 0x0c/0x0a/0x06 = r6/r5/r3). WIDTH IS TAKEN MOD 32, OFFSET IS LITERAL (EXP-0139 DEF-0139-2, HW, dense 0..63): `width` is taken MOD 32 -- the mod-32 model fits 64/64 stable values while a literal/clamp-at-32 model fits only 37/64, so width == 0 (mod 32) is the no-mask (extract-to-MSB) case and width=32 behaves exactly like width=0. `offset` on the SAME instruction obeys the OPPOSITE rule: it is literal, and 32..63 shift the field out entirely (result 0). The asymmetry is load-bearing for an emitter. ⚠ `sign_ext` (byte+6 bit 1) IS NOT THE SIGN CONTROL -- DEF-0171-3 (EXP-0171, G17P; re-derived in EXP-0175). It is DENSE-INERT over both its sub-values in BOTH compiler anchors -- the unsigned `extract_bits` form (a7 00 56 04 02 00 10 00 f0 11 61 00) and the SIGNED one (a7 00 56 02 03 00 12 00 f0 10 61 00) -- on three carriers x two gated runs, while byte+6 AS A WHOLE moves 254 of its 256 values on every one of those carriers, so the instrument demonstrably has detection power. db.json's earlier 'signed sets sign_ext' was a CORRELATION ACROSS TWO COMPILER FORMS, not a control. The two anchors differ in byte+3 (0x04->0x02), byte+4 (0x02->0x03), byte+6 (0x10->0x12) and byte+9 `srcC_flags` (0x11->0x10); the attribution of signedness to srcC_flags bit 0 is INFERRED -- byte+9 was not swept. The field keeps its name only so its validation.json evidence row survives; treat its role as UNKNOWN. SCOREBOARD CORRECTION (EXP-M4-42): bits12..17, including the former `b2_bit0` and `store_en` positions, are one six-slot pending dependency mask; the older per-bit labels are superseded.*

The blanket change is REFUSED: every 14-byte instance this project has HW-VALIDATED (EXP-0013 whole programs icmp_lt / ucmp_lt / fcmp_lt, which run on hardware and tokenize with zero leftover) has byte+2 == 0x1d, and both 10-byte hardware sites have byte+2 == 0x2d. The length is therefore CONTEXT-DEPENDENT and the corpus-fitted rule and the G17P measurement disagree exactly where each is silent about the other -- the same shape as the half_alu_fma12 length disagreement. A candidate narrowing (byte+2 == 0x2d -> 10, byte+2 == 0x1d -> 14) was measured A/B by EXP-0212 against the 1080-file own-MSL corpus; see that experiment's RESULTS.md for the numbers. Recorded here so the disagreement is visible rather than smoothed away.*

*d = (int|uint)(a)  ; float/half -> integer convert with continuation-selected rounding. byte+7 bit6 (0x40) = signed (int) vs unsigned (uint). byte+3 = dst reg (dst<<1), byte+5 = src reg (src<<2) -- BOTH byte-diff PROVEN (EXP-M4-13 R9) by a reversed-lane float4<->int4 chain: byte+3 steps 0,2,4,6 with the RESULT lane while byte+5 steps 0x18,0x14,0x10,0x0c with the SOURCE lane (the two move in opposite directions, so dst and src are separately located). Canonical generated signed FP32-to-I32 recipe (EXP-0238): `27 07 56 (D<<1) 02 (S<<2) b4 48 03 00`, D=0..95 and S=0..63. It reads then releases the source; if source equals destination, release precedes result publication and the integer result wins. bits12..17 are the six-slot pending dependency mask: byte+1's high nibble names slots1..4 and byte+2's low bits name slots5..6; byte+2 high six bits are residual operand mode. byte+4 is the source format/class descriptor. Float-to-integer is ten bytes: an eight-byte core plus a two-byte continuation. byte+8 bit0 participates in destination format/sign/saturation, byte+8 bit1 selects RTE(0) versus RTZ(1), and byte+9 is reserved/inert in the tested envelope (EXP-M4-42/43). Mode/class exact per-VALUE maps are role-typed (byte-diff located), not independently splice-proven (no fabricated value map).*

*r[n] = r[n] & 0xFFFF -- 16-bit ZERO-extend / narrow, IN PLACE on ONE register used as BOTH source and destination. n = byte0's HIGH nibble. REGISTER FIELD RECOVERED -- HW (EXP-0161, G17P; re-derived independently in EXP-0165, db_defects :: DEF-0161-2). The pre-2026-08-30 descriptor pinned byte0 to the full fixed byte 0x13 and modelled byte+1 as the source register, so the real register selector was invisible to an emitter and the modelled one did nothing. Measured: a dense byte0 sweep in a synthesized carrier (the instruction alone, r0..r14 seeded by device_load from an authored buffer, judged by the 16-register dump) shows byte0 = 0xN3 narrows r[N] AND NOTHING ELSE, for N = 0..10, 11 of 11 fits with 0 misfits in both gated runs; nibbles 0xB..0xF execute as a NO-OP (no register changes at all) -- 4 independent observations each. No byte0 value whose LOW nibble is not 3 ever performs the narrow (all 16 low-nibble buckets checked). GENERATED: 11 of 16 `r[n] = r[n] & 0xFFFF` encodings pass a host-computed 16-register prediction; the 5 failures are exactly the 0xB..0xF no-op nibbles. One anomaly is recorded rather than smoothed: nibble 0x8 (r8) narrowed correctly in 4 of 5 observations (both gated sweeps, gen01, gen02) and was a no-op once (gen03). byte+1 IS NOT A SOURCE REGISTER -- HW-TESTED INERT over all 256 values (128 values of bits 0-6 x both values of bit 7), in a carrier where the instruction is demonstrably live (its byte0 := 0x00 falsifier fires) and where fifteen device_loads and a sentinel store separate the source from the instruction, so ALU forwarding cannot explain it; reproduced in a SECOND register form (byte0 = 0x53, i.e. r5) as its own gated pair. This CLOSES EXP-0146's open question -- which left (a) 'byte+1 is not a source selector' and (b) 'the operand was ALU-forwarded from the preceding device_load' undecided -- as (a). EXP-0146's own carrier is also shown to be dead: the falsifier byte0 := 0x00 scores `ok` there (the correct a & 0xFFFF still comes out), so that arm proves nothing either way. byte+1 keeps its historical name `src_flag` (now the whole byte, not a 1-bit flag) ONLY so the per-field evidence chain in validation.json survives a db.json field cannot be renamed without editing that file; it is an inert byte, not a flag and not a source selector. MATCH: byte0's low nibble (3) is the group discriminator -- this is the same compact 4-byte n3 group as `n3_mov`, of which this descriptor is the ZERO-EXTEND member -- and byte+3's low 3 bits (0b001) are the zero-extend companion discriminator: all 32 of 256 byte+3 values with (v & 0x07) == 0x01 reproduce the narrow exactly and no other value does, so bits 3-7 of byte+3 (`extend`) are free. `subform` (byte+2) accepts (v & 0xC7) == 0x00, 8 of 256, identically in both register forms. NEGATIVE controls (EXP-M4-13, own-MSL) still stand: SIGN-extend short->int does NOT use this op (it lowers to an iadd/bfe sign path) and 8-bit narrow uchar does NOT either (ilogic AND 0xff), so this really is the 16-bit ZERO-extend. RELATIONSHIP TO `n3_mov` (EXP-0174, G17P; recorded in EXP-0175): this is the NARROW member (byte+2 & 0x07 == 0) of the same low-nibble-3 instruction, not a separate opcode. DEF-0174-1 -- the one-bit-off operand byte -- applies to the MOVE sub-form and is corrected on `n3_mov` / `frame_marker`. It is deliberately NOT applied here: this descriptor's byte+1 is a single 8-bit `src_flag`, HW-TESTED INERT over all 256 values in two independent register forms (EXP-0161, re-derived EXP-0165), and EXP-0174 reconfirms `93 0a 00 01` leaves r5 untouched. An operand byte the narrow sub-form does not read is exactly what an inert byte+1 looks like; do not copy the move sub-form's operand model here without a sweep.*

*packed format-conversion pack: pack_float_to_unorm2x16 / snorm / half -> a 32-bit packed word (COMPUTE, gated by byte+2==0x56). src_desc (byte+1) = source/mode descriptor. src (byte+3) = source GPR. mode (byte+4) = mode/size (0x02/0x03). fmt_word (byte+5..+9) = the format-conversion / rounding descriptor -- kept raw (n=4; not individually decoded). OPERAND MODEL WRONG (EXP-0144, HW): the field named `src` at byte+3 is the DESTINATION. The real sources are byte+5 (`reg<<2`) and byte+6 (`reg<<3`), and byte+9 is a FORMAT selector (`0x4x` snorm2x16 / `0x8x` unorm2x16 / `0xcx` unorm 8-bit lanes). byte+7 rule recovered by revalidation where run03 lost it to hangs: 256/256, `(v & 0xfb) == 0x50`. EMITTER SUMMARY (EXP-0144, HW): destination = byte+3, sources = byte+5 / byte+6, format = byte+9. The old `src` name at byte+3 would have made an emitter write the result to the wrong register. FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `fmt_class` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1).*

*packed format UNPACK/convert: unpack_unorm2x16_to_float / snorm -> a float2. byte0 0x17, 8 bytes. src_class (byte+1, low nibble 0x04 fixed by match). cache (byte+2) bit1 = source cache / last-use hint (0x56 fresh vs 0x54 cache/last-use, EXP-0038). convert_desc (byte+3..+6) = the format-conversion descriptor -- kept raw. byte+7: low nibble (size) = a size/const (0xa typical); high nibble (reg_sel) = a register selector, most likely the unpack RESULT destination -- it steps e/b/c/a/6/3 across successive unpacks in one kernel (role inferred, not splice-confirmed). Distinguished from simd_ballot (byte+1 low nibble != 4) by the match. MATCH RELAXED (EXP-0119 defect, 2026-08-28): the match previously pinned every bit of byte+2 except bit1 (constraints [16,1,0] and [18,6,21]), so bytes EXP-0119's 7-bit re-sweep constructed -- which the HARDWARE ran, reproducing the baseline exactly -- did not re-decode as unpack_convert. Our decoder was stricter than the silicon. The byte0=0x17 + byte+1-low-nibble==4 pair already separates this from simd_ballot, so the byte+2 pins were over-fitting to the corpus rather than encoding a real constraint. Removed: [[0, 8, 23], [8, 4, 4], [16, 1, 0], [18, 6, 21]] -> [[0, 8, 23], [8, 4, 4]] byte+2 EXACT RULE (EXP-0144 revalidation, HW, 256/256): the instruction reproduces iff `(byte & 3) != 0` -- a TWO-BIT OR-ENABLE. This reconciles EXP-0089 (0x54, `&3==0`, breaks) with EXP-0119 (single-bit flips of 0x56 all inert) as one rule rather than two conflicting observations. NOTE: db.json's relaxed match (commit 2b1cbc50) is still not the hardware rule -- it is permissive where the hardware is not. OPERAND MODEL WRONG (EXP-0144): `convert_desc` is really dst / inert / src / opcode, and `reg_sel` is a FORMAT selector, not a register. BYTE+7 BIT3 (EXP-0144, HW): bit3 of byte+7 -- the top bit of the `size` field -- changes which SOURCE register is read; it is not part of the format selector.*

*HALF-LANE PACK (assemble a half2 into a packed 32-bit register). `18 05 18 03` (4 bytes). Combines the two fp16 lanes produced by the native-half 0x10 ALU (EXP-0033 half_alu) into one 32-bit word for the device store (and the reverse assembly for half unpacks). Confirmed 4 bytes across half2 add (`18 05 18 03`), mul (`18 05 19 03`) and fma (`18 05 1b 07`). byte0 HIGH nibble = destination register nibble -- the SAME op appears as 0x08/0x18/0x28/0x38 for dst r0/r1/r2/r3 (this descriptor matches the 0x18 dst-r1 form). byte+2 = source register (reg<<1)|hint. A longer 6-byte high-register form (byte+2==0x24, seen as 0x30/0x38 in the broad corpus) is a documented follow-up. short2/short4 (int16) does NOT pack. LENGTH RULE OVER-CONSTRAINED (EXP-0154 DEF-0154-1): the rule accepts byte0 == 0x18 as a 4-byte `half_pack` only when byte+1 == 0x05 and (byte+2 & 0xf8) == 0x18. Our own G17P `half2 add` emits `18 03 18 05` — byte+1 = 0x03 — so the gate rejects it and 22 bytes of our own compiled shader fail to tokenize. Needs a corpus A/B before relaxing; not applied here. LENGTH CONFIRMED 4 BYTES BY SPLICE CONTROL (EXP-0160 DEF-0160-4, HW, G17P; re-derived in EXP-0165). Replacing bytes +2..+3 with our own 2-byte `mov_imm r6, 77` leaves r6 holding its SEED -- the mov_imm never executes, so those bytes are consumed by the instruction at +0. Replacing BOTH 2-byte halves with two mov_imms executes both (r6 = 77 AND r7 = 99): the positive control that proves the probe can see a difference in exactly that slot. So DEF-0154-1's A18 `18 05 18 03` vs G17P `18 03 18 05` is an operand swap INSIDE one 4-byte instruction, not two 2-byte instructions reordered. The isadb.py length gate on byte+1 == 0x05 is therefore wrong; dropping it was MEASURED in EXP-0165 (work/probe_hp) and IMPROVES the corpus metric -- clean files 833 -> 833, strict leftover bytes 388604 -> 388584 -- but it is a length-rule change in isadb.py and is left for the length-rule owner. [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] CORRECTED AND EXTENDED BY EXP-0203 (G17P, host-oracle match on full post-state). (1) WRITE TARGET: this member writes the destination's HIGH 16 bits and PRESERVES its LOW 16 bits; its byte0-low-nibble-0 sibling writes the LOW half. The name `pack` is a misnomer for what was measured -- a per-lane fp16 ALU op on the HIGH lane, which is exactly why a `half2` operation takes ONE INSTRUCTION PER LANE (4 arms x 512 field cases, full-post-state oracle match 100%). (2) SOURCE RELEASE: at byte+2 = 0x18 the instruction ZEROES both named source half-lanes (opflags 3 source release), and WHICH lane is zeroed follows the descriptor's value -- so the release is part of the field's semantics, not a constant side effect. Every release-free candidate model scored 2/80; with the release the arithmetic member scores 80/80, confirmed on 2048 gated field cases. (3) LENGTH GATE, INDEPENDENT HARDWARE CONFIRMATION of DEF-0154-1: the HARDWARE consumed exactly FOUR bytes for ALL 256 byte+1 values (all four 2-byte length markers survived in every case, every arm, every run), while `isadb.instr_length` accepts byte0 == 0x18 as a 4-byte half_pack only when byte+1 == 0x05 -- so our own tokenizer returned `<unknown>` for the anchor `18 0d 18 11` and disagreed with itself on 11 of the 256 byte+1 values. THE BYTE+1 GATE IS NOT A LENGTH CONDITION. The length rule is NOT changed here (it is the length-rule owner's file); this is the second independent measurement asking for it. Evidence: raw/g17p_run31..32. [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] THE byte0 MATCH IS RELAXED from 8 pinned bits (0x18) to 4 (low nibble 0x8) by EXP-0203; byte0's high nibble is now the `dst` field. Before this edit no db-expressible half_pack could write any register but r1.*

*d = LUT2(a, b) ; 2-input bitwise logic (all 16 boolean functions). srcA (byte+1) / srcB (byte+3) = the two source register descriptors (srcA at the falu srcA position, srcB at byte+3). op_base (byte+2 bit0) picks the xor vs and/or base; lut_a (byte+4 low bits) and lut_b (byte+5 bit3) are the per-source / output inverts -> any of the 16 LUT2 functions. outmod (byte+7) bit7 = an output/store flag (set for the store-consumed forms, clear for the compare-consumed dec2 forms). z6/z8/z9 = zero tail. ~a is the fmov(0x0e) op with an invert. ALL 16 TWO-INPUT BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS (EXP-0146, HW-VALIDATED): EXP-0102 INT-12's '10 of the 16' was a statement about what MSL SOURCE reaches, not about the encoding. The selector triple (op_base, lut_a & 3, lut_b & 0x0f) produces ALL 16 two-input boolean functions from this instruction alone, collision-free -- one HW-validated encoding per function is tabulated in experiments/EXP-0146-m4-emit-int-misc/analysis/ilogic_lut_table.md. `lut_b`'s 1-D live bits are 0,1,2 and 4 ((v & 0x17) == 0 for AND, free mask 0xe8), but bit3 IS function-selecting jointly with lut_a (it turns AND into a_and_not_b on the xor base) -- use the joint table, not the 1-D mask. ⚠⚠ OPERAND LABELS ARE SWAPPED RELATIVE TO THE PUBLISHED LUT TABLE (EXP-0154 DEF-0154-5, HW-VALIDATED G17P). `ilogic` reaches all 16 boolean functions, and EXP-0146's table at `experiments/EXP-0146-m4-emit-int-misc/analysis/ilogic_lut_table.md` reproduces **16/16 on G17P — but only when its `a` is read as db.json's `srcB` (byte+3) and its `b` as db.json's `srcA` (byte+1).** Scored under db.json's own field names the table gives **8/16, and the eight that fail are EXACTLY the eight ASYMMETRIC functions.** An emitter that combines that table with these field names therefore emits half the boolean functions BACKWARDS while the symmetric half still looks correct — so the bug surfaces late and looks data-dependent. Either swap the names here or swap them at the table; do not leave both as they are. SEPARATELY (DEF-0154-2): db.json models byte0 as a fixed 8-bit match (0x0b) and lists **no destination field at all** for this instruction. ⚠ BYTE0 IS `(dst << 4) | 0x0b` -- DEF-0171-1, HARDWARE-PROVEN (EXP-0171, G17P; independently re-derived from that experiment's raw in EXP-0175). The pre-2026-08-30 descriptor pinned byte0 to the full 8-bit value 0x0b, so it described DESTINATION r0 ONLY and an emitter following it could never write `ilogic` anywhere else; every other destination fell through to b_alu10_lof / b_alu10_loe, whose low-nibble match is accompanied by a modelled `dst`. MEASURED: a dense byte0 sweep in a 16-GPR-dump carrier puts the AND result (93 & 107 = 73) in register `byte0 >> 4` for EVERY value whose low nibble is 0xb -- 15 of 15 observable destinations, 0 misses, in BOTH gated runs. (r15 is unobservable in that carrier by construction: it is the harness's own store-index register, re-seeded before each dump.) `dst` is now modelled and the match is the low nibble. UNMODELLED DEGREE OF FREEDOM, recorded not folded (EXP-0175): byte0 BIT 3 is a DON'T-CARE on this datapath. The same sweep shows low nibble 0x3 reproduces the identical 16-register result for 15 of 16 destinations -- `0x23 03 1f 01 ...` gives a byte-identical register state to the anchor `0x2b 03 1f 01 ...`. Bit 3 is NOT folded into the match because byte0 low-nibble 3 is a populated, separately HW-validated group (n3_mov / mov_zext16 / n3_addr_prep) and this observation was made only at byte+2 == 0x1f; what bit 3 selects is UNKNOWN. ⚠ byte+7 BIT 7 IS A SOURCE-READ CONTROL, NOT AN OUTPUT/STORE FLAG -- DEF-0171-4 (EXP-0171, G17P, HW-VALIDATED; re-derived in EXP-0175). With bit 7 CLEAR the LUT still evaluates and the destination register is still written: the read-back buffer is un-poisoned and both integrity sentinels are intact on all 128 such values, and the DISCRIMINATOR is `nand` -- k_and/k_or/k_xor/k_andn write 0x00000000 but k_nand writes 0xFFFFFFFF, which is ~(0 & 0). A flag that zeroed the OUTPUT would give 0 for nand too. It is BOTH SOURCES that read as zero. Reproduced on five independent store-consumed carriers, both gated runs, and in a fresh-process adversarial re-run (20/20, 5 reps each). The effect is visible ONLY when the result is consumed by an adjacent memory operation: on a 16-register-dump carrier the same 256 values are inert, which is why EXP-0154 read the field as inert on G17P. ALTERNATIVE NOT EXCLUDED: a writeback/publish control whose absence is invisible when the consumer is far away. ACTIONABLE RULE FOR AN EMITTER (target-independent either way): clearing byte+7 bit 7 on a logic op whose result is consumed by a memory operation LOSES THE OPERANDS.*

*d[dst] = special_register[sr_sel]  ; read a built-in/special register (thread/threadgroup/simd IDs & dimensions; VS vertex_id/instance_id/base_*; FS position/front_facing) into a GPR. sr_sel = BYTE1 is the SR number (NOT byte0-hi, which is the dst GPR LOW nibble). The full destination register is dst = byte0[4:8] | (byte+3[5:8] << 4), reaching r0..r127 -- dst_hi (byte+3 bits5-7) is the register EXTENSION. byte0 low-3-bits = 0b100; bit3 (form) is a datapath/width modifier (set for the position-in-grid SR family) that does not change the SR select. byte+2 (dp_width) is a datapath width / dst-bank descriptor. byte+3 low 5 bits are a fixed 32-bit-read marker (0x06). IDs are read on demand -- no stage preloads them into GPRs. Constant-folded builtins (e.g. threads_per_simdgroup=32) use the 2-byte mov_imm instead. [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] THE dst_hi CLAUSE ABOVE IS REFUTED ON G17P by EXP-0207 and must not be relied on. `dst_hi` (byte+3 bits 5-7) was INERT across 8 of 8 values on FIVE arms in TWO stages (compute sr_c/sr_dump/sr_hi, fragment sr_f/sr_f2), two gated runs in opposite case order, 100% per-value agreement -- with the in-dimension control firing on every arm: splicing `dst` (the LOW half of the same register number) moves the observable, and on the register-dump carrier it clobbers a NAMED codeword slot (slot 9 at dst=10), so a relocated write IS visible to this read-back plan. Relocating `dst_hi` clobbers nothing and changes nothing. What DOES move the destination bank is `dp_width` (byte+2): the documented 0x50 `top dst bank` ladder step moves the observable and clobbers codeword slot 8. Bounded to the compiled dst values on those five carriers, dst_hi 0..7 (which is its full range).*

### `mov_imm` — 2-byte small-immediate move (constant-folded builtins)

*d[dst] = imm7  ; 2-byte move of a small immediate into a GPR. The compiler uses it for constant-folded built-ins (e.g. threads_per_simdgroup = 32 = 0x20). IMM WIDTH CORRECTED (EXP-0128, refined by EXP-0140): only SEVEN bits are load-bearing. EXP-0140 CORRECTS the mechanism -- with imm_top=1 the instruction does NOT write the destination register AT ALL, and unpadded it CONSUMES THE FOLLOWING 2-byte instruction. EXP-0128 reported a 'silent zero' only because its read-back buffer was zero-initialised; against a buffer poisoned with 0xDEADBEEF the register is seen to keep its previous value (seed 7 retained under a padded control; the poison word survives unpadded). So bit 7 SELECTS A DIFFERENT, LONGER INSTRUCTION -- it does not extend the immediate and it does not zero. `imm_top` (bit 15) is that inert 8th bit. An emitter MUST range-check to 0..127 and lower larger constants some other way; combined with iadd2's N=0 self-read this silent zero produced two real GPU hangs during EXP-0128's pilot. TOKENIZATION HOLE (EXP-0140): imm7 == 12 is the ONLY immediate in 0..127 that does not tokenize under the current length rule -- byte+1 = 0x0C makes the 2-byte pair look like the 4-byte 0x?c preamble/get_sr group. Checked exhaustively over 0..127. An emitter must avoid imm7 == 12 or pad around it. IMMEDIATE IS 7 BITS (EXP-0140, HW, poisoned read-back): with imm_top = 1 (immediate 128..255) the instruction does NOT write the destination register at all, and unpadded it CONSUMES the following 2-byte instruction. EXP-0128 read this as a 'silent zero' only because its read-back buffer was zero-initialised; against a poisoned buffer the register is seen to keep its previous value (0xDEADBEEF survives). An emitter must treat the immediate as 7 bits: bit 7 selects a different (longer) instruction, it does not extend the immediate. DECODER GAP (EXP-0140, static): the 2-byte encoding with imm7 == 12 does not tokenize under the current length rule -- byte+1 = 0x0C makes the pair look like the 4-byte low-nibble-0xC preamble/get_sr group. It is the ONLY immediate in 0..127 with this property, checked exhaustively over all 16 dst values. Decoder defect, not necessarily a hardware one; fixing it is a LENGTH-RULE change and is deferred to a corpus A/B.*

*conventional program-end word (whole body of an empty kernel). NOT a strictly-enforced terminator and NOT parameterized: the 24-bit body is RESERVED PAD -- HW-proven non-load-bearing (corrupting any of it is a no-op, EXP-0003/EXP-0010 E4). A driver emits 0x000000. The true end-of-program is out-of-band (the metadata code length), not this in-band token. There is NO scope/mask/wait operand: the 'end-of-program flags/scope' hypothesis is DISPROVEN by the EXP-0010 E4 splice-inertness result. Typed `imm` (reserved pad) because the bits are fully LOCATED and their role is fully KNOWN (inert padding); the rare nonzero corpus bodies are trailing-padding / mid-stream context words, not a decoded field. [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] CORRECTED BY EXP-0206 (G17P, three carriers, two gated runs). The clause `corrupting any of it is a no-op` is TOO STRONG and is withdrawn: it is true only for the byte values previously tried. THE FINAL WORD IS FETCHED AND EXECUTED. The 24-bit BODY is inert over 73 sampled values on three carriers, and byte0 values 0x00/0x01/0x0c/0x0d/0x2e/0xff are harmless -- but replacing BYTE 0 with a control-flow leader (0x0f or 0x8f) FAULTS reproducibly on all three carriers and in both runs. Most opcodes with an all-zero body happen to be harmless; a branch or return leader is not. Separately, a MID-PROGRAM `stop` genuinely terminates: synthesized over the optional 4-byte frame marker it leaves the pre-sentinel written and all 32 value words still POISON. THE DRIVER RULE IS UNCHANGED: emit 0x000000. Evidence: CTRL:byte0@* and stop.reserved@synth_mid@* arms.*

Sub-32 signed types are sign-extended by a following ALU shift; unsigned use the zero-extend load.  [CORRECTED 2026-08-28 -- EXP-M4-13's dst FORMULA IS WRONG] dst = dst_lo | (dst_ext9<<2), used by every prior experiment and by this DB, PREDICTS THE WRONG REGISTER. The register a later falu2/falu2i must reference is extmode/2, i.e. extmode = 2 x target_register (EXP-0101, HW-VALIDATED across target registers 3/7/16/20 and both ALU forms, with 11/11 compiler-emitted load->ALU pairs independently confirming). dst_lo/dst_ext9 are a SEPARATE, independently required field that must be copied VERBATIM from a compiler-observed value ((1,1) for terminal scalar 32-bit loads) and never derived from the target register -- 4 adversarial cases break the load if derived, even with extmode correct. This mis-formula, not the consumer route, was the true cause of EXP-0099's ROUTE_LOAD failure. Target register aliases r(R mod 64) for R in [64,112] and faults at 126/127 (EXP-0112). DESTINATION REGISTER RULE (EXP-0141, HW-VALIDATED, supersedes the EXP-M4-13 formula retracted by EXP-0101): `dst_lo`/`dst_ext9` carry NO register information. To land a load in register R: `extmode = 2*R` (bit 0 is a DON'T CARE), `dst_lo = 1` EXACTLY, and `dst_ext9` bit 0 = 1. Three constrained bits of the nine those two fields span. Verified exhaustively: extmode values 0..127 all work and 128..255 all fail, so R is reachable only for **R = 0..63** -- R >= 64 silently zeroes through this field. Identical at r3/r7/r20/r33 and under all 21 working `ld_format` codes. How many of `dst_ext9`'s UPPER bits are additionally don't-cares is `ld_format`-dependent (free for 16 codes, tighter for 3/7/9/13 and 39), but `dst_ext9 = 1` is valid under all 21. DESTINATION-PAIR AND ADDR_MODE (EXP-0141, HW): `dst_lo` and `dst_ext9` carry NO register information. dst_lo must be exactly 1; only bit 0 of dst_ext9 is live and must be 1. Three constrained bits out of the nine the two fields span; the other six are don't-care. Established by 4/4 dst_lo values and 128/128 dst_ext9 values at four independent target registers (3, 7, 20, 33) plus the full 512-value 2-D product at r7, with an identical accepted set at every target register. SUPERSEDES EXP-M4-13's dst = dst_lo | (dst_ext9 << 2) (already retracted by EXP-0101) and EXP-0101's advice to copy the pair verbatim per addr_mode/ld_format shape: the pair is a fixed 3-bit enable pattern, not a per-shape token. Separately, `addr_mode` (byte+2) is INERT for a terminal scalar 32-bit indexed load -- all 256 values load correctly, including every code in the enum. CAVEAT: only that shape was tested; the enum may still select behaviour for the base-sharing / CF / RT forms it names.*

NOTE the correction from EXP-0093: the accompanying `07 02 54 01` / `87 02 54 01` bracket is the ORDINARY UNCONDITIONAL FRAGMENT EPILOG, NOT a kill/mask companion as EXP-0091 first reported. A proper split of this collision is a pending DB change. OPCODE COLLISION, UNRESOLVED SPLIT (EXP-0091; still open as of 2026-08-28): byte0=0x57 with byte+2=0x54 is a SIX-byte fragment kill / target-mask op, not this eight-byte vertex vary_store. The fixed 8-byte length mis-tokenizes it. EXP-0093 separately corrected the companion reading: the `07 02 54 01` bracket is the ordinary fragment epilog, not a kill/mask partner. DO NOT EMIT vary_store for byte+2==0x54; the split needs a discriminating match plus a length rule that is byte+2-aware, which needs new hardware evidence. COLLISION RESOLVED (EXP-0162, HW-VALIDATED G17P) — and the long-standing premise was WRONG. **byte+2 does NOT discriminate**: 0x54/0x55/0x56 occur in BOTH populations and byte+2 is 256/256 INERT on hardware in both forms. db.json's own flag text said otherwise and was mistaken. **The real selector is byte+1 bit1**: 615/615 vertex tokens set it, 10/10 fragment tokens clear it. On hardware, setting it on the fragment op kills the fragment while 0x14->0x1c is null (reproducing EXP-0091's M4 result); mirrored on the vertex side, clearing bit1 corrupts the store AND downstream channels. byte+6 is live (so the VS form really is >= 7 bytes) and byte+7 inert. The 6-byte fragment form is now the separate `frag_sample_submit`. Length rule: `8 if (byte+1 & 2) else 6`. A/B: 833 clean files (+1), -268 leftover bytes, round-trip ALL PASS, exact population conservation.*

*General 14-byte device atomic packet. The former byte+1==0x11 `atomic_rmw` and byte+1==0x01 `atomic_mem` split is superseded: byte+1's high nibble and byte+2's low two bits are one six-bit input dependency mask, `mask = pending_mask_lo | (pending_mask_hi << 4)`, with bit 0 naming slot 1 through bit 5 naming slot 6. Materialized GPR inputs use zero; a directly pending input names its producer slot. byte+2's high six bits retain the common 0x54 packet mode. byte+5 bits0..6 select the address index, while byte+5 bit7 and byte+6 bits0..5 form the data GPR index. Compare-exchange consumes the adjacent data-register tuple in desired,compare order. In the tested per-lane form, byte+9 is 0x02 for a returned result and 0x40 when discarded. A returning atomic is followed by `atomic_result`, which independently names the destination GPR and publication slot. The operation is byte+12 bits1..5: add, sub, and, or, xor, signed/unsigned min/max, exchange, compare-exchange, and float add. The tested last-use form releases its address/data inputs. The historical `atomic_rmw` and `atomic_mem` descriptors remain as narrower compatibility aliases, but their byte+1 values are dependency-mask examples rather than distinct operand classes.*

Code 7 is unresolved and must not be emitted.

The actual RMW operand register is implicit (supplied by the preceding op / amode), as in the 0x67/0xe7 load/store family. Emitted AFTER a SIMD-group simd_reduce pre-combine; NOT a CAS/retry loop. OPERAND REGISTER IS ENCODED, NOT IMPLICIT (EXP-0141, HW-VALIDATED): the RMW operand register is carried in byte+5 bit 7 and byte+6 bits 0..5 -- `index = (byte+5 >> 7) | ((byte+6 & 0x3F) << 1)` -- indexing the operand register window.

It is encoded, as `oper_reg_lo` (byte+5 bit7) | (`oper_reg_hi` << 1) (byte+6 bits 0..5). The carrier keeps a[0..3] = 7/1007/2007/3007 live across atomic_fetch_add(o, a[0]); baseline byte+5/+6 = 0x00/0x00 counts 7, byte+5 = 0x80 counts 1007, byte+6 = 0x01 counts 2007, and the addendum built index 3 -> 3007. The redirected register is CONSUMED: its later reader gets 0. NOTE: our atdevimm carrier uses a UNIFORM address yet the compiler emits byte+5/+6 = 0x80/0x02, which the old per-lane-index reading does not explain; the address role is not excluded for the per-lane form, but the DATA role is proven for the uniform form.*

LOD/bias/grad and the depth-compare reference are register operands set up by preceding ALU. Same op in compute and fragment; implicit LOD needs a fragment stage.  [CORRECTED 2026-08-28] The bundle's op+4 byte is NOT a stable per-texture binding ID: textures declared at indices 5, 50 and 100 produce op4_sequence [0,128,0], i.e. it is a COMPILER-REUSED REGISTER/UNIFORM SLOT (EXP-0114). The field itself is 4 BITS (the byte's upper nibble) with the lower nibble PROVABLY INERT (12/12 constructed values); all 14 unpopulated nibble values were constructed and every one yields a deterministic SILENT ZERO, never a fault or alias. The true 0-127 binding-index selector lives in a still-UNDECODED PRECEDING POINTER-LOAD instruction. Gather offset is a signed [-8,7] per-axis field, HW-confirmed affine and alias-free at all 12 boundary/corner points and accepting a genuinely dynamic per-lane offset (EXP-0106).*

*texture[slot].write(color, coord). Memory-family store (byte0 0xd7, low-nibble 7, sibling of the 0x67/0xe7 buffer load/store). Distinct from the sampler-path read: writes go through the store path, reads through the sample op. byte+9 = coordinate dimensionality (0x04 for a 2-coordinate 2d/2d_array write, 0x08 for a 3d write, 0x0c for a cube write); byte+4 = the extra-coordinate operand register (the array layer / cube face; 0x20 present for an array/layer store, 0 for a plain 2d/3d store); byte+1/+5..+7 = the coordinate/data operand register pack; byte+12 low nibble = a per-texture-op write-sequence index (0x88 base + N for the Nth write in a shader); byte+13/+14 = the write-data (color) source-register descriptor (0x3a/0x09 for a contiguous vec4 register block, 0xfa/0x08 when the four components are assembled from scattered sources). The write-data REGISTER itself is implicit / carried by these descriptors, matching the device_store finding that the store DATA register is not a standalone field. TEXTURE SLOT is NOT in this instruction (writing to texture 0/1/2 is byte-identical) -- it is bound via texture state, resolved outside this op. Fragment or compute.*

Computes the texel address / normalized cube-face-or-array coordinate / explicit-LOD or bias / const gather offset that the following tex_sample (0xb0/0x90) sampler op consumes as its coordinate/LOD register operands. Emitted 1..N per sample. (The 0x27 byte+2 form gets the same length but is not separately named here; the descriptor matches the 0x2f coord/interp form.) EXP-M4-13 R7 CORRECTION: this 10-byte byte+2==0x2f op is POLYMORPHIC and NOT texture-specific -- across the own corpus it appears as (a) vertex attribute-fetch / varying destination-address setup (byte+4==0x42; byte+7 = dst-slot index = dst<<2) and (b) a float-classify / modifier ALU (isnan/isnormal/frexp/modf; byte+3 = srcA, byte+4 in {0x00,0x10,0x12,0x22}). The mnemonic is retained for stability but is a misnomer. FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `subop` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1).*

*byte0 0x43 is the dst=r4 member of the low-nibble-3 compact MOVE / zero-extend / half-pack family (identical field layout to n3_mov; dst r4 is fixed by the matched byte0). TWO roles share the encoding: (1) CALL-SITE / FRAME-SETUP marker -- the special form `43 00 00 01` (srcA=0, subform=0x00, companion=0x01 = the SAME `X3 00 00 01` zero-extend-companion shape as mov_zext16 `13 00 00 01`) is emitted immediately before every out-of-line CALL; `43 00 06 xx` is the non-leaf-frame prologue. In object/mesh stages this marker precedes the compiler helper-subroutine calls (write_childcount/write_uvb) -- NOT a mesh-emit op (set_vertex/index/primitive lower to ordinary 0xe7/0xd7 stores, EXP-0030). (2) ORDINARY COMPACT MOVE into r4 -- the general byte+1/+2/+3 forms (e.g. `43 a6 21 00`, `43 08 0e c1`, `43 0a 07 9f`) are register moves: srcA_reg (byte+1 bits0-6) = source register, srcA_uni (byte+1 bit7) = uniform-file/high-half flag, subform (byte+2) = source-class/size sub-form, companion (byte+3) = second-operand/pack descriptor -- the same fields, values and neighbour ops (reg_move / rt_ray_mem / sr_read_wide) as n3_mov to other dst regs. ⚠ OPERAND BYTE CORRECTED BY INFERENCE, NOT BY MEASUREMENT ON THIS DESCRIPTOR -- DEF-0174-1. byte+1 = `(S << 1) | hs` -- the ORDINARY AGX 8-bit operand descriptor, the same `(reg<<1)|size` shape every other operand byte in this database uses. S (bits 1..7) = the SOURCE GPR; hs (bit 0) = which 16-bit HALF of it is read (0 = low, 1 = high). ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-08-30, DEF-0174-1: the descriptor used to model this byte as `srcA_reg` = bits 0..6 plus `srcA_uni` = bit 7 with an enum {0: gpr, 1: uniform/hi} -- ONE BIT OFF. An emitter following that wrote S into bits 0..6, which the hardware reads as register S>>1 with half-select S&1: the WRONG REGISTER AND THE WRONG HALF, silently, with no fault. MEASURED (EXP-0174, dense byte+1 0..255 x 2 register plans x 2 gated runs, 100.000%% cross-run agreement): re-derived independently in EXP-0175 by scoring the two models against a host-computed 16-bit-granular oracle -- the corrected model fits 32 of 32 host-known values in every plan and run; db.json's fits 3 of 32. The aliasing period is 64, reproduced 128 of 128 (byte+1 = v and v+128 give byte-identical 16-register dumps), which is why bit 7 -- register bit 6 -- reads as inert. NO UNIFORM FILE IS REACHABLE THROUGH THIS BYTE at any value. The 16-bit granularity is independently visible in the same data: the one seeded source with a non-zero high half (r9 = 0x40200000) is the single case where a whole-32-bit-register reading fails and the half-granular oracle succeeds. EVIDENCE STATUS FOR *THIS* DESCRIPTOR: `STRUCTURAL`/`INFERRED`. EXP-0174 swept `n3_mov`; it did NOT sweep `frame_marker`. This descriptor's byte+1 fields were copied from the same (wrong) model, so the correction is applied here for consistency -- but nothing has executed a `frame_marker` with a chosen source register. OPEN QUESTION, recorded not resolved (EXP-0175 DEF-0175-1): `frame_marker` matches byte0 == 0x43 exactly, while EXP-0174 measured byte0 = (dst << 4) | 0x3 for this whole group, which makes 0x43 simply `dst = r4`. Whether `frame_marker` is a distinct instruction at all is unresolved; the corpus cannot adjudicate it (identical clean/leftover either way) and it needs its own experiment.*

*direct out-of-line CALL: `0f 05 54 1a 8f 00 56 <off40> 00` (14 B). offset = a SIGNED little-endian PC-relative byte displacement; branch target = (call_addr + 4) + offset. Reuses the execution-mask push (0f 05) machinery -- a masked branch that saves the return context -- so byte+4=0x8f and byte+6=0x56 are the CALL/link signature (also the 14-vs-8-byte disambiguator vs a plain predication push). Bracketed by the 0x43 frame marker (before) and a 0f 06 reconverge (after). Args in r10,r11,r12..; return value in r10; return via ret (0x8f).*

*INDIRECT CALL through a function pointer (visible_function_table / intersection_function_table). Leader `0f 80 ..`: byte+1 0x80 selects the call-to-address variant of the control-flow group (vs 0x00 jump, 0x05 direct call). The target is a CODE VA loaded into a register from the function table (entry[i] = 8-byte code VA of function i's entry point); this op transfers control to it and returns via the same ret (0x8f). Per-lane (dynamic) targets are marshalled through a run of 0x4b move ops before the 0f 80.*

*NON-LEAF FUNCTION FRAME PROLOGUE. `6f 03 04 00 00 20` (6 bytes; the broader corpus also shows `6f 03 54 00 00 10`). Emitted at the entry of a NON-leaf callee (one that itself CALLs) to establish the per-thread SCRATCH frame in which it saves/restores its return/link register around each inner call. Leaf callees have no prologue and return via `8f 02 54 00`; a non-leaf callee has this prologue, brackets each nested CALL with the 8-byte 0x07 link save/restore, and returns via `8f 12 54 00`. HW-VALIDATED (splice, A18 EXP-M4-14, own-MSL frame.metal k_chain->mid()): subop (byte+1) is the frame sub-op selector -- only bits[1:0]==0b11 are load-bearing (0x03/0x0b/0x13/0x23/0x43 all run; 0x00/0x01/0x02/0x04 fault), bits[7:2] don't-care/reserved. marker (byte+2) is RESERVED/inert (0x04->0x00/0x54/0x55/0xff all run to baseline; corpus shows 0x04 and 0x54). frame_size (bytes+3/+4/+5, little-endian, +5 low byte) is the scratch frame/allocation size: high bytes +3/+4 must be 0 for these small frames (nonzero -> huge frame -> GPU fault); byte+5 is 16B-granular (0x20->0x30 over-alloc tolerated, 0x10/0x1f/0x21 too small/misaligned -> fault). NB byte+5 sub-encoding is not cleanly monotonic (0x40 faults while 0x30 runs), so its sub-field layout is not fully resolved -- see hypotheses. MERGES the DB's former separate b3/b4/frame_size raw fields.*

Same 0x07 fence/ordering family as the compute threadgroup_barrier (EXP-0025) and fragment pixel_order (EXP-0029), but an 8-byte form gated by byte+1==0x00 (the barrier/pixel-order forms are 6 bytes, byte+1 in {0x04,0x14}). A non-leaf callee spills its own link register because each inner CALL clobbers the hardware link register (ret 0x8f encodes no return target). HW-VALIDATED (splice, A18 EXP-M4-14, own-MSL frame.metal): in a RACE-FREE frame (k_chain, no spills) the op is a NO-OP fence and every payload field is inert; in a SPILLING frame (k_bigframe / bigmid, 12 live temporaries around the call) the fields become load-bearing. byte0=0x07 is the fence-family opcode (0x07->0x00 corrupts the SAVE / HANGs the RESTORE when state actually spills). scope (byte+4=0x81) = scratch/stack scope: bit7 AND bit0 must both be set (0x81/0x83 pass; 0x00/0x80/0x01 corrupt; 0xff -> GPU page-fault; RESTORE-side corruption HANGs). dir_offset (bytes+5/+6, 16-bit LE) = scratch save/restore offset+direction: SAVE=0x0000, RESTORE=0x1fff; intermediate values relocate the scratch access (corruption scales with value). CORRECTION: dir_offset is 16-bit (bytes+5/+6), NOT the DB's former 24-bit field -- byte+7 (reserved7) is RESERVED/inert on BOTH the SAVE and RESTORE instances. marker (byte+2) and b3 (byte+3) are RESERVED/inert; b1 (byte+1) is mostly reserved (low bits inert, only 0xff perturbs). FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `b1`, `marker`, `scope` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1).*

OPERAND SELECTORS (all HW-splice-validated, EXP-O2C, on mad_f32 read back over one 32-lane simdgroup): byte+5 = A (LEFT) multiply-operand fragment register (splice +5 to B's reg -> B*B; swap +5/+6 -> B*A -- matmul is non-commutative so all A*B/B*A/A*A/B*B distinguishable); byte+6 = B (RIGHT) operand register; byte+7 = C accumulator source register; byte+8 = destination fragment register; byte+3 = an A-operand sub-descriptor (corrupting -> ZERO result: load-bearing); byte+10 = op-enable marker 0x24 (corrupting -> C passthrough, the multiply drops out); byte+4 and byte+9 bit1 splice-inert (padding). dtype (byte+1): 0x00 = 16-bit (half), 0x02 = 32-bit (float; bfloat shares the 32-bit datapath with input conversion; splicing 0x02->0x00 garbles fp32). mode (byte+2): 0x56 standalone, 0x54 tiled (MPP matmul2d) -- SEMANTIC, not a hint: splicing standalone 0x56->0x54 ZEROES the result (tiled mode sources its accumulator from the MPP tile context). ACCUMULATE-ENABLE = byte+11 bit0 (1 -> a*b+c, 0 -> a*b; simdgroup_multiply clears it). MSL element types: half, float, bfloat (incl. mixed half/bfloat -> float accumulate); integer matrices REJECTED (no int8 cooperative matrix). Only 8x8 exposed. ALL MPP tensor ops (matmul2d multiply/multiply_accumulate/transpose/f32/16x16x16/2-simdgroup) lower to THIS SAME op -- no new tensor opcode; transpose adds 4-byte data-move ops (ray_move family), not a new op; simdgroup_load/store (incl. transpose=true) are ordinary 0x67/0xe7 memory ops. ACCUMULATOR SIGN CONTROL, NOT PADDING (EXP-0147, HW-VALIDATED): byte+11 bits 1-2 (the `b11hi` field's bits 0-1) select the sign of the C addend per tile half -- bit0 makes rows 0-3 use -C, bit1 makes ALL rows use -C, and both set cancel back to +C. Correct `a*b+c` therefore requires `(b11hi & 3) == 0`; 32 of 128 values give it. **The matrix unit computes `A*B - C`**, a mode Metal's `simdgroup_multiply_accumulate` never emits. `dst_desc` rule: bit6 = 1, bit7 = 0, bits 0-5 don't-care.

Emitted twice: op#1 traverse, op#2 (byte+2 0x10/0x11, trailing `26 9f`) result-read. The BVH TRAVERSAL itself is a compiler-generated shader loop (one -88-byte back-edge per intersector) using this op + the 0xdf AS-loads + the 0x5f ray-data ops -- NOT a fire-and-forget trace. PRIMITIVE TAG does not change the op (bounding_box op#1 == triangle op#1 byte-for-byte; curve differs only in the dst-reg nibble): tag discrimination lives in the AS + intersection-function-table. Works IDENTICALLY from a FRAGMENT shader (supportsRaytracingFromRender, HW-validated) -- only the bind stage differs. FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `subop` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses.

A compact move in the 0xNb family (sibling of the compact call-argument move / uniform_mov); disambiguated by byte+2 in {0x80,0x81}. The SAME op is reused (35-38 per kernel) to marshal MPP matmul2d TRANSPOSE tile data -- i.e. matrix transpose is data movement, not a matrix opcode. b3 (byte+3) is an operand type/size/CLASS descriptor (0x08=reg32 plain copy, 0x00=zero, 0x12/0x22=uniform/high-class-source copy, 0x06=zero variant); HW-shown structurally significant (splice, A18 EXP-M4-14: b3 bit6=0x40 on a uniform-class-source copy -> CMDBUF_ERROR; inert on plain copies). NEGATIVE (splice): the b3/src VALUE-semantics could NOT be splice-resolved -- all 16 ray_move ops are INERT to committed_distance in the intersection_query testbed (the traversal re-derives origin/direction from the direct device loads of rin[], so the marshalled ray copy is not its data sink); a getter returning a marshalled ray field is needed to pin the value map (see hypotheses). FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `form` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses.

*threadgroup_barrier(mem_flags) -- execution barrier + memory fence. 6 bytes: 07 <sub> 54 <mem_scope> <flags> 00. sub (byte+1): 0x04 = compute threadgroup/execution barrier, 0x02 = fragment tile-access / imageblock-ordering barrier (byte+1==0x00 is the 8-byte link save/restore, lengthed away). mem_scope (byte+3) = fenced memory scope: 0x41 mem_none, 0x61 mem_threadgroup, 0x85 mem_device, 0x51/0xd1 mem_texture (OWN-MSL byte-diff: base 0x41, +0x20 threadgroup, +0x10 texture, device 0x85). flags (byte+4) = memory-class (0x09 tg/none, 0x08 device, 0x0e texture). b5 (byte+5) = reserved pad, const 0x00 (own-MSL + corpus). Makes threadgroup-memory stores by OTHER lanes visible before the barrier returns; the compiler emits it between a threadgroup store and a cross-lane threadgroup load. It is the ONLY explicit ordering/'wait' op in the compute stream (device load/store/atomic/texture are HW-register-interlocked, not scoreboard-waited). simdgroup_barrier emits no 0x07 op (a 32-lane SIMD-group is lockstep). Removing/neutralising the fence -> silent stale threadgroup reads (no fault).  [CORRECTED 2026-08-28] compute threadgroup_barrier(mem_texture) is a GENUINE ACQUIRE (sub=0x14) / RELEASE (sub=0x04) INSTRUCTION PAIR, correcting an earlier provenance note that recorded sub=0x04 for both members (EXP-0093). byte+3 bit0 (0x85 vs 0x84) is the EXECUTION-CONVERGENCE enable, independent of the requested memory-fence class. Separately, simdgroup_barrier compiles byte-identically to no barrier in simple contexts (EXP-0104) but is NOT universally a no-op -- divergent call-count patterns force real branch machinery (EXP-0115).*

Ordering is realised by fence PRESENCE, not a bit on the 0x67 atomic RMW op: memory_order_relaxed emits NO fence, seq_cst emits this fence (acquire/release/acq_rel are REJECTED by MSL). Scope GATES emission: thread/simdgroup/threadgroup scope emit no device fence; thread_scope_device (default) does.

*fragment PIXEL-ORDERING op (raster_order_group / fragment-interlock). kind (byte+1): 0x14 acquire/wait, 0x04 release/signal. scope (byte+3): memory scope {0x50,0xd0} (bit7 differs) -- located mod. flags (byte+4): the raster-order/device fence flag (0x06, coincides with the match constant). b5 (byte+5, constant 0x00). Brackets an ordered RMW of a [[raster_order_group]] resource. Raw bytes retyped raw->mod by located role; scope/flags value map needs splice. ⚠ DESCRIPTOR SELF-CONTRADICTION (EXP-0147): this descriptor declares field `flags` at bits[32:40] AND carries a match constant pinning those same bits to 0x06. Hardware accepts 112 (acquire) / 224 (release) distinct values there with the program byte-exactly correct, so **every legal encoding with byte+4 != 0x06 is currently neither decodable nor emittable**. The match must be relaxed; not done here because it changes how existing programs decode and needs a corpus A/B like EXP-0148's. MATCH CORRECTED (EXP-0162, HW-VALIDATED G17P): the descriptor declared field `flags` at bits[32:40] while ALSO pinning those bits to 0x06, so every legal encoding with byte+4 != 0x06 was neither decodable nor emittable. Fixed by dropping the byte+4 pin and requiring **byte+3 bit4 and bit6** instead — a byte the corpus fitting never reached. Round-trip 302/0, corpus byte-identical, **zero firings move**, and four HW-verified encodings become decodable. Detection power was proved quantitatively first: corrupting byte+4 loses exactly 7 of 8 raster-order updates (texel 8*src -> 1*src; pixel clear+36*src -> clear+8*src). The decisive new evidence is cross-form: `07 14 54 51 0e 00` and `07 04 54 d1 0e 00` — the `threadgroup_barrier(mem_texture)` pair our own MSL compiles to — are **byte-for-byte substitutable in both directions with ordering intact**, so they ARE the pixel_order pair. The compute barrier, fragment tile barrier and device fence all lose the same 7 of 8 updates, contradicting the earlier over-claim on hardware rather than by corpus counting.  DEF-0181-1 -- `scope` CANNOT BE NARROWED, and the reason is a second defect (EXP-0181, re-derived from EXP-0147's committed raw). This descriptor's match pins instruction bits 28 and 30 (byte+3 bits 4 and 6), which lie INSIDE the 8-bit `scope` field, so `scope` declares 8 bits of which only 6 are choosable and assemble() refuses 192 of its 256 values. The free bits are 24..27, 29 and 31 -- NOT CONTIGUOUS -- so no single (start,width) field can express them, and truncating `scope` to the contiguous run 24..27 would make bit 31 unencodable, which is precisely the acquire-vs-release distinction (0x50 vs 0xd0) this descriptor documents. Splitting `scope` into three fields WOULD express them, but the match those boundaries would be drawn around is itself contradicted by the committed measurement: EXP-0147's dense M4 sweep (256 values x 2 gated runs, both carriers) accepts byte+3 iff bit4==1 AND (bit6 XOR bit7)==1 in the ACQUIRE member and iff bit4==1 AND bit7==1 in the RELEASE member. Neither accept set is contained in the match's legal set {high nibble 5,7,d,f}: each carrier accepts 32 values the match REJECTS (high nibbles 9 and b) and rejects 32 the match ADMITS. The bit-30 pin comes from EXP-0162 on G17P and the refuting sweep from EXP-0147 on M4, so this may be a target difference or a carrier difference; it is NOT resolved here and no boundary is moved on the strength of it. Consequence for a label auditor: `scope`'s recorded range "full 8-bit range, dense (256 cases)" overstates the field by 4x -- only 64 of those 256 values are legal under this descriptor.*

*r_dst = interpolate(varying_slot=src_slot, mode)  ; per-fragment varying interpolation ('iter'). One op per float4 component. byte+5 = the per-triangle varying/coefficient slot (slot<<1); byte+3 = destination GPR; byte+6 = interpolation location: 0x00 pixel-centre/linear, 0x02 centroid or per-sample (paired with the 8-byte iter_at setup + a 0x04/0x03 position preamble), 0x04 the perspective denominator (W) channel. PERSPECTIVE-CORRECT interpolation is a multi-instruction lowering, NOT a single mode bit: linear component iters (byte+6==0x00) + a W-denominator iter (byte+6==0x04) + a 0xaf reciprocal (rcp of interpolated 1/w) + a per-component fmul. [[flat]] uses the separate 6-byte iter_flat op instead (no barycentric interp). The pull-model interpolate_at_center/centroid/sample compile BYTE-IDENTICALLY to the matching [[*_perspective]] qualifier. FOLDED INTO `match` (EXP-0175, from EXP-0173's audit): `c7` had ZERO free bits -- every bit of the span is pinned by this descriptor's own `match`, so there is exactly one legal value and it is not a field an emitter chooses. The name, span and pinned value are preserved in `match_notes`. An emitter-grade label on such a row was a vacuous claim (DEF-0170-1).*

### `iter_at` — interpolate-at setup (centroid / sample)

*interpolate-at SETUP: computes the custom barycentric coordinate for centroid / per-sample / interpolate_at_* interpolation, consumed by the following iter ops (which carry byte+6==0x02). byte+7 = 0x01 centroid, 0x03 sample. Preceded by a sample/centroid-position preamble read (byte0 0x04 centroid / 0x03 sample).  FIELD NARROWED (EXP-0181, from EXP-0168 section 7): `grp` declared bits 0..7 over a match that pins bits 0..6 to 0x2f, so byte0 has exactly TWO legal values, 0x2f and 0xaf, and every other value is a decode desync -- which is why three experiments hit hangs sweeping it and why EXP-0168's arm was stopped after 4 of 256 values. `grp` is now the single free bit 7. MEASURED, G17P, EXP-0168 rclean07/08/09 (three gated runs, identical in all three): grp=1 (byte0 0xaf) is `ok` on both the centroid carrier r_i8 and the 4-sample carrier r_i8s; grp=0 (byte0 0x2f) is `wrong_value` on r_i8 and `ok` on r_i8s. So bit 7 changes the observation at 1 sample and not at 4. The two out-of-descriptor values dispatched (0x00, 0x01) HUNG the device on both carriers, in all three runs.*

Each RT store is bracketed by 0x87 tile-access setup ops; colour values are packed into GPRs by preceding 0x97 ops. discard_fragment suppresses the store. [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] UNDECODED FORM, RECORDED AS A GAP (EXP-0207, G17P): a fragment shader returning a struct with a `[[sample_mask]]` member alongside `[[color(0)]]` at 4 samples emits NO frag_color_store at all, and its program does not tokenize -- one `<unknown>` record and a 20-byte leftover (`a2113f15801003c09f015410031e600014041215`). No descriptor here covers the sample-mask colour-output form. Evidence: raw/prefreeze/census03.*

*read the CURRENT tilebuffer / colour-attachment value into a GPR — the ld_tile analogue for PROGRAMMABLE BLENDING (a fragment [[color(n)]] INPUT). Load-family op (byte0 0x67) with the fragment variant byte+1==0x0e (compute device load uses byte+1 in {0x10,0x00,0x11,...}). On Apple TBDR the framebuffer lives in tile memory, so blend is done in-shader (EXP-0019): the shader reads the destination colour with this op and computes the blend with ordinary float ALU, then stores with frag_color_store. READ-ENABLE (EXP-0147, HW-VALIDATED): byte+6 bit 0 is a read-enable -- EVEN values return a SILENT ZERO rather than faulting, and so does a wrong `rt_index`. In a BG/EOT program that surfaces as a BLACK TILE, not a loud failure. Detection proof: forcing the read to zero collapses the pixel from dst*2+src to src on 4/4 pixels and 4/4 components, byte-exact in both runs.*

Same op as frag_color_store, GENERALISED: byte+5 = SLICE ADDRESSING = the field's BYTE-OFFSET WITHIN THE IMAGEBLOCK STRUCT, encoded (offset>>1). HW-proven: a GB imageblock {half4 albedo@0, half4 normal@8, float depthv@16} stores with byte+5 = 0x00 / 0x04 / 0x08 (=0,8,16 >>1). byte+7 = slice data format (0x0e half4, 0x22 float). This DIFFERS from simple-MRT frag_color_store where byte+5 = render-target index (rt<<1): explicit imageblocks address by BYTE-OFFSET, MRT addresses by RT index. img.write(v) writes the WHOLE struct (one 0xe7 per field). Bracketed by 0x87 frag_tile_setup + a 0x07 tile fence.*

*write the shader [[depth]] output to the tile depth buffer. Memory-family store (byte0 0xd7) with the fragment depth variant byte+1==0x14, byte+2==0x54, 6 bytes — distinct from the 16-byte texture write (also 0xd7). Bracketed by 0x87/0x07 tile-access ops whose byte+3==0x01 selects the depth attachment (vs 0x0c for colour RT0). [EXP-0212, applied 2026-08-30] MATCH CORRECTED BY EXP-0199 (G17P, the first experiment ever to read the Depth32Float attachment back per pixel). The descriptor's ROLE is now OBSERVED, not inferred: unmutated, the depth attachment holds the shader's [[depth]] output exactly at three probe pixels with three DISTINCT values on TWO independent carriers with DIFFERENT depth functions, matching the host oracle in both; clearing byte+5 bit 1 makes the depth attachment receive 0.0 at every covered pixel while the colour value at every covered pixel is unchanged (128 of 256 b5 values, identically on both carriers and in both captures); 0 of 2304 mutations of this instruction's own bytes moved the COLOUR surface while leaving the depth surface unchanged; and with the instruction REPLACED the tile is discarded entirely and the depth attachment keeps the clear value 1.0. TWO MATCH BYTES WERE OVER-DECLARED: byte+1 was pinned to the whole byte 0x14 but only two bits are required -- the accepted set is exactly (v & 0x06) == 0x04, 64 of 256 -- and byte+2 was pinned to 0x54 but IS NOT ENFORCED AT ALL, 256 of 256 accepted on both carriers in both captures. The arm's detection power is proven on the same instruction by b5, b3, b4 and byte+1. Accepted sets for the operand bytes, same arm: b3 4 of 256, (v & 0xfc) == 0x00; b4 8 of 256, (v & 0x1f) == 0x00; b5 128 of 256, (v & 0x02) == 0x02. Bounded wording for the byte+2 result: `inert over 0..255 in the c_depth and c_depth2 fragment carriers with a depth attachment; global role unknown`.*

## Length rule (byte 0)

Parcels are 2 bytes (all lengths even). Length is a function of byte 0 plus a per-group length bit/signature. The authoritative rule is `instr_length()` in `tools/agx-isa/isadb.py`; this table summarizes it:

| byte 0 (group / signature) | length (bytes) |

| `0xNb (byte+2 in {0x80,0x81})` | 4  [RAY register-marshalling MOVE (ray_move): byte+2==0x81 copies a computed reg into the block rt_intersect consumes, 0x80 zero-inits a component. Reused 35-38x for MPP matmul2d TRANSPOSE tile moves. EXP-O2C] |
| `0xcf operand decode` | the 0xcf matrix_mac operands are now FULLY decoded (EXP-O2C splice): byte+5=A (left) operand, byte+6=B (right), byte+7=C accumulator src, byte+8=dst, byte+3=A sub-descriptor (load-bearing), byte+10=op-enable 0x24, byte+1=dtype, byte+2=mode (0x56 standalone SEMANTIC vs 0x54 tiled/MPP), byte+11 bit0=accumulate-enable. All MPP tensor ops lower to this one op. |
| `0x11` | 6 if byte+1==0x03 (fp32->fp16 convert cvt_f2h); else 8 if byte+1 in {0x02,0x04} (NATIVE bfloat ALU add/mul, opsel byte+2 0x1c/0x1d) or 10 if also (byte+2 & 0x02) (bfloat fma, opsel 0x1e). LOAD-BEARING FIX (EXP-O2D): the old flat `8 if byte+2&0x02 else 6` mis-lengthed every bfloat op (bf_add 0x1c -> 6, bf_fma 0x1e -> 8) and desynced bfloat kernels. Disambiguate on byte+1 -- cvt_f2h and bf_add SHARE opsel byte+2==0x1c. |
| `0xe7 (byte+1 in {0x06,0x16})` | 12  [fragment COLOUR STORE (0x06 frag_color_store) / explicit imageblock<T>.write (0x16 = first tile store after a 0x87 setup, imageblock_store): byte+5 = imageblock field BYTE-OFFSET>>1 (vs MRT's RT index rt<<1), byte+7 = slice format. EXP-0029/O2D] |
| `0x67 (byte+1 in {0x06,0x0e,0x16})` | 12  [fragment TILEBUFFER READ (0x0e tile_read, programmable blend) / explicit imageblock<T>.read (0x06/0x16 tile variant, imageblock_load). EXP-0029/O2D] |
| `0x07 (byte+2==0x54, byte+3==0x84)` | 6  [DEVICE MEMORY FENCE (mem_fence): atomic_thread_fence(mem_device, seq_cst) = `07 04 54 84 0a 00`. byte+3 0x84 = device-memory FENCE (vs threadgroup_barrier's 0x85 device = 0x84\|0x01, the 0x01 = the added EXECUTION barrier); byte+4 0x0a = device memory-class flag. Ordering realised by fence PRESENCE, not a bit on the 0x67 RMW op (relaxed emits no fence, seq_cst emits it; acquire/release REJECTED by MSL). mem_texture is a byte+4==0x06 pair that decodes as pixel_order. EXP-O2D] |
| `get_sr SR 0x84` | simd_is_helper_thread (FS): the get_sr-family leader `04 84 11 06`, read then compared. Distinct from 0x82 simd_lane_id / 0x85 simd_group_id. EXP-O2D |
| `simd_reduce byte+1==0x06 bit7` | FLOAT simd_product / prefix-product (bit7=1, byte0=0xbf) vs simd_sum (bit7=0, byte0=0x3f); byte+7 0x32 = FLOAT exclusive-scan. INTEGER product has no native reduce op (shuffle+multiply tree). EXP-O2D |
| `simd_shuffle byte+1==0x06` | simd_shuffle_and_fill_up/down (fill data = a separate preceding 0x67 load) / rotate; modulo variant changes byte+6 (0x4a->0x42) + a tail modulo byte. EXP-O2D |
| `0x?0 (byte0 low nibble 0x0; high nibble = dst reg)` | Native fp16 low-half ALU. Direct G17P EXP-0180 table, implemented for canonical arithmetic forms: with o=byte+2&7 and m=byte+4&3, o in {0,1,2,3,7}: 10/10/10/8; o=4: 6/8/10/6; o=5: 6/8/10/8; o=6: 6/8/10/12. Texture leaders with overlapping byte0 values retain higher-priority local discriminators. EXP-0180; independently re-derived in EXP-0183. |
